Please help improve it by rewriting it in a balanced fashion that contextualizes different points of view.  December 2018   Learn how and when to remove this template message  In 2009, the first conference named devopsdays was held in Ghent , Belgium . The conference was founded by Belgian consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois. 8   who  9  The conference has now spread to other countries. 10  In 2012, the State of DevOps report was conceived and launched by Alanna Brown at Puppet. 11  12  As of 2014, the annual State of DevOps report is published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble and others. 13  14  In 2014, they found that DevOps adoption was accelerating. 13  Also in 2014, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory write the book More Agile Testing, containing a chapter on testing and DevOps. 15  16  In 2015, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim found DORA DevOps Research and Assessment. 17  In 2017, Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim published Accelerate Building and Scaling High Perfoming Technology Organizations. Toolchains  edit  Some of this sections listed sources may not be reliable . Please help this article by looking for better, more reliable sources. Unreliable citations may be challenged or deleted.  December 2018   Learn how and when to remove this template message  Main article DevOps toolchain As DevOps is intended to be a cross-functional mode of working, those that practice the methodology use different sets of tools referred to as  toolchains  rather than a single one. 18  These toolchains are expected to fit into one or more of the following categories, reflective of key aspects of the development and delivery process 19   unreliable source  20   unreliable source  Coding  code development and review, source code management tools, code merging Building  continuous integration tools, build status Testing  continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks Packaging  artifact repository , application pre-deployment staging Releasing  change management, release approvals, release automation Configuring  infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools Monitoring  applications performance monitoring , end-user experience Some categories are more essential in a DevOps toolchain than others especially continuous integration e.g. Jenkins , Gitlab , Bitbucket pipelines and infrastructure as code e.g., Terraform , Ansible , Puppet . 21   unreliable source  22   unreliable source  Forsgren et al. found that IT performance is strongly correlated with DevOps practices like source code management and continuous delivery . 13  Relationship to other approaches  edit  Agile  edit  Main article Agile software development Agile and DevOps serve complementary roles several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration , and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates informally to the 1990s, and formally to 2001. 23  Agile can be viewed as addressing communication gaps between customers and developers, while DevOps addresses gaps between developers and IT operations  infrastructure. 24  Also, DevOps has focus on the deployment of developed software, whether it is developed via Agile or other methodologies. 23  . ArchOps  edit  ArchOps presents an extension for DevOps practice, starting from software architecture artifacts, instead of source code, for operation deployment. 25  . ArchOps states that architectural models are first-class entities in software development, deployment, and operations. Continuous delivery  edit  Main article Continuous delivery Continuous delivery and DevOps have common goals and are often used in conjunction, but there are subtle differences. 26  27  While continuous delivery is focused on automating the processes in software delivery , DevOps also focuses on the organizational change to support great collaboration between the many functions involved. 26  DevOps and continuous delivery share a common background in agile methods and lean thinking  small and frequent changes with focused value to the end customer. 28   unreliable source  Lean management and continuous delivery are fundamental to delivering value faster, in a sustainable way. 14  Continuous delivery focuses on making sure the software is always in a releasable state throughout its lifecycle. 13  This makes it cheaper and less risky to deliver the software. 13  Improved collaboration and communication both between and within organizational teams can help achieve faster time to market , with reduced risks. 29  30  DataOps  edit  Some of this sections listed sources may not be reliable .

March 2019   Learn how and when to remove this template message  Main article Site reliability engineering In 2003, Google developed site reliability engineering SRE, an approach for releasing new features continuously into large-scale high-availability systems while maintaining high-quality end-user experience. 33  While SRE predates the development of DevOps, they are generally viewed as being related to each other. 34   unreliable source  Systems administration  edit  This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it .  June 2018  DevOps is often viewed as an approach to applying systems administration work to cloud technology. 35  WinOps  edit  Main article WinOps WinOps is the term used for DevOps practices for a Microsoft-centric view.  citation needed  Goals  edit  Some of this sections listed sources may not be reliable . Please help this article by looking for better, more reliable sources. Unreliable citations may be challenged or deleted.  March 2019   Learn how and when to remove this template message  IT performance can be measured in terms of throughput and stability. 13  Throughput can be measured by deployment frequency and lead time for changes stability can be measured by mean time to recover. The State of DevOps Reports found that investing in practices that increase these throughput and stability measures increase IT performance. 13  14  The goals of DevOps span the entire delivery pipeline. They include  citation needed  Improved deployment frequency Faster time to market  Lower failure rate of new releases Shortened lead time between fixes Faster mean time to recovery in the event of a new release crashing or otherwise disabling the current system. Simple processes become increasingly programmable and dynamic, using a DevOps approach. 36   unreliable source  DevOps aims to maximize the predictability, efficiency, security, and maintainability of operational processes.  citation needed  Very often, automation supports this objective. DevOps integration targets product delivery , continuous testing , quality testing , feature development, and maintenance releases in order to improve reliability and security and provide faster development and deployment cycles.  citation needed  Many of the ideas and people involved in DevOps came from the enterprise systems management and agile software development movements. 37   unreliable source  Practices that correlate with deployment frequency are 13  Continuous delivery Using version control for all production artifacts Practices that correlate with lead time for change are 13  Using version control for all production artifacts Automated testing Practices that correlate with mean time to recovery for change are 13  Using version control for all production artifacts Monitoring system and application health Companies that practice DevOps  failed verification  have reported significant benefits, including significantly shorter time to market , improved customer satisfaction, better product quality, more reliable releases, improved productivity and efficiency, and the increased ability to build the right product by fast experimentation. 29  The 2014 State of DevOps Report found that IT performance strongly correlates with well-known DevOps practices such as use of version control and continuous delivery. 13  Criticism  edit  There is a lack of evidence in academic literature on the effectiveness of DevOps. e  A similar absence exists in practice. F5 Networks , found that only one in five surveyed IT professionals thought that DevOps had a strategic impact on their organization despite rise in usage. The same study found that only 17 of those surveyed identified DevOps as key, well below software as a service 42, big data 41, and public cloud infrastructure as a service 39. 38  Cultural change  edit  DevOps initiatives can create cultural changes in companies 39  by transforming the way operations , developers , and testers collaborate during the development and delivery processes. 2  Getting these groups to work cohesively is a critical challenge in enterprise DevOps adoption. 40  41  DevOps is as much about culture, as it is about the toolchain. 42  DevOps as a job title  edit  While DevOps describes an approach to work rather than a distinct role like system administrator , job advertisements are increasingly using terms like  DevOps Engineer . 43   unreliable source  44  While DevOps reflects complex topics, the DevOps community uses analogies to communicate important concepts,  relevant  discuss  much like  The Cathedral and the Bazaar  from the open source community. 45  Cattle not Pets the paradigm of disposable server infrastructure. 46  10 deployments per day the story of Flickr adopting DevOps. Building a DevOps culture  edit  Organizational culture is a strongest predictor of IT and organizational performance. Cultural practices such as information flow, collaboration, shared responsibilities, learning from failures and new ideas are central to DevOps. 13  Team-building and other employee engagement activities are often used to create an environment that fosters this communication and cultural change within an organization. 47  Teambuilding activities can include board games , trust activities, and employee engagement seminars. 48   unreliable source  The 2015 State of DevOps Report discovered that the top seven measures with the strongest correlation to organizational culture are 1. Organizational investment in DevOps 14  2. Team leaders experience and effectiveness. 3. Continuous delivery. 4. The ability of different disciplines development, operations, and infosec to achieve win-win outcomes. 5. Organizational performance. 6. Deployment pain. 7. Lean management practices. Deployment  edit  Some of this sections listed sources may not be reliable . Please help this article by looking for better, more reliable sources. Unreliable citations may be challenged or deleted.  March 2019   Learn how and when to remove this template message  Companies with very frequent releases may require knowledge on DevOps.  citation needed  For example, the company that operates image hosting website Flickr developed a DevOps approach to support ten deployments a day. 49  Daily deployment cycle would be much higher at organizations producing multi-focus or multi-function applications.  citation needed  Daily deployment is referred to as continuous deployment 50   unreliable source  or continuous delivery 51   unreliable source  and has been associated with the lean startup methodology. 52   unreliable source  Professional associations and blogs posts have formed on the topic since 2009. 53   unreliable source  54   unreliable source  Architecturally significant requirements  edit  To practice DevOps effectively, software applications have to meet a set of architecturally significant requirements ASRs, such as deployability, modifiability, testability, and monitorability. 55  These ASRs require a high priority and cannot be traded off lightly. Microservices  edit  Although in principle it is possible to practice DevOps with any architectural style, the microservices architectural style is becoming the standard for building continuously deployed systems. 30  Small size service allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring, 56  hence reducing the need for a big upfront design,  citation needed  allows for releasing the software early  citation needed  and continuously. DevOps automation  edit  DevOps automation can be achieved by repackaging platforms, systems, and applications into reusable building blocks through the use of technologies such as virtual machines and containerization . 57   unreliable source  58  Implementation of DevOps automation in the IT-organization is heavily dependent on tools, 13  59   unreliable source  which are required  citation needed  to cover different areas of the systems development lifecycle SDLC Infrastructure as code  Ansible , Terraform , Puppet , Chef CICD  Jenkins , TeamCity , Shippable, Bamboo, Azure DevOps Test automation  Selenium, Cucumber , Apache JMeter Containerization  Docker , Rocket, Unik Orchestration  Kubernetes , Swarm, Mesos Software deployment  Elastic Beanstalk, Octopus, Vamp Measurement  Datadog, DynaTrace, Kibana, NewRelic, ServiceNow ChatOps  Hubot, Lita, Cog Adoption  edit  Some of this sections listed sources may not be reliable .
