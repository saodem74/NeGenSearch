John Mylopoulos From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search John P. Mylopoulos born 12 July 1943 is a Greek-Canadian computer scientist , Professor at the University of Toronto , Canada, and at the University of Trento , Italy. He is known for his work in the field of conceptual modeling , specifically the development an agent-oriented software development methodology . called TROPOS. 1  2  Contents 1 Biography 2 Work 3 Selected publications 4 References 5 External links Biography  edit  Born in Greece in 1943, Mylopoulos in 1966 received his Bachelor of Engineering from Brown University . In 1970 he received his PhD from Princeton University under supervision of Theodosios Pavlidis with the thesis, entitled On the Definition and Recognition of Patterns in Discrete Spaces. 3  In 1966 he started his academic career as Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto , where he in 1971 he was appointed Professor in Computer Science. In 2009 he was also appointed Professor of Computer Science at the University of Trento . In 1986, Mylopoulos was elected President of the Greek Community of Toronto. He served for 2 years until 1988. Mylopoulos was awarded the Peter P. Chen Award for outstanding contributions to the field of conceptual modeling in 2010. In 2012 he also received an honorary doctorate from the RWTH Aachen University in recognition of his excellent and distinctive contributions on the methodology of conceptual modeling as a basis for databases, software technology and artificial intelligence, as well as its interdisciplinary applications.. 4  Work  edit  Mylopoulos research interest ranges from information modelling techniques, specifically semantic data models , to knowledge based systems and information system design and to the field of requirements engineering . 5  Borgida et al. 2009 summarized, that Mylopoulos made four mayor contributions in these fields .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 TORUS Natural-language access to databases, which required the representation of the semantics of the data, and hence first led us to conceptual models of relational tables using semantic networks. TAXIS Programming language for data-intensive applications which supported classes of objects, transactions, constraints, exceptions and workflows, all orthogonally organized in sub-class hierarchies with property inheritance. TELOS Representation language for knowledge of many different kinds of software engineering stakeholders, including application domain and development domain, which exploited meta-classes, and treated properties as object TROPOS Applying the ideas of early requirements goal orientation, agent dependence to the entire range of software development, and expanding its scope to many topics, including security and evolution.
