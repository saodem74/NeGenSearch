The adopted suitability model estimates the optimal environmental conditions for European tree species under present and future climates. Available years 2000, 2020, 2050, 2080. For year 2000 the observed WorldClim climate conditions have been used. For years 2020, 2050, 2080 the climate conditions simulated for the climate change scenarios A2 and B2 have been used by means of the climate models CCCMA, CSIRO, HANDCM3 and of an ensemble model of them. eurovoc domains Environment , Agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food , Science and technology Resources Download Download Provisional data Download Output data Compressed archive of geotiff maps Provisional data Documentation Download Landing page HTML URI httpdata.europa.eu88udatasetbe08bb9f-5fea-451a-a23d-8535d7fcde60 Identifier be08bb9f-5fea-451a-a23d-8535d7fcde60 Landing Page httpdata.europa.eu89hbe08bb9f-5fea-451a-a23d-8535d7fcde60 Release Date 2009-09-18 Modified Date 2009-09-18 Geographical Coverage Liechtenstein, Italy, Jersey, Monaco, Morocco, Croatia, Hungary, Isle of Man, Ireland, United Kingdom, Guernsey, Slovakia, Slovenia, San Marino, Serbia, Romania, Russia, Poland, Portugal, Netherlands, Norway, land Islands, Kosovo, Andorra, Albania, Belgium, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Belarus, France, Montenegro, Malta, Algeria, Czechia, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Gibraltar, Finland, Estonia, Faroes, Vatican City, Lithuania, Greece, Tunisia, Moldova, Ukraine, Turkey, Latvia, North Macedonia, Luxembourg, Sweden Language English Contact European Commission, Joint Research Centre JRC jrc-fise-infoec.europa.eu httpec.europa.eujrc Did you find what you were looking for Keywords mathematical analysis forest resource natural resource modelling spatial distribution Europe climatic change deciduous tree biodiversity scientific research forest Environment climate change deciduous forest Species Distribution EuroVoc concepts deciduous tree forest biodiversity scientific research climate change Catalogue record Added to data.europa.eueuodp 2012-12-14 Updated on data.europa.eueuodp 2019-03-27 Views 411 Downloads 1 function loadFooter jQuerydocument.onready,function jQueryop-footer-full.loadeuodpencontact op-footer-fulldiv.flex-row service share, renderTo new-share-button, lang en, stats true, css button shareButton Sitemap About this site Legal notice Contact Top ISSN 2315-3091 Cookies This site uses cookies to offer you a better browsing experience.
