She is Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley , 2  where she is also Director Emerita of CITRIS the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society. She was previously Professor and Chair of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania , where she was the founding Director of the University of Pennsylvanias General Robotics and Active Sensory Perception GRASP Laboratory, and a member of the Neurosciences Institute in the School of Medicine. She has also been head of the National Science Foundation s Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate, with authority over a 500 million budget. At Pennsylvania, she supervised at least 26 doctoral students who received the Ph.D. 3  Contents 1 Early life 2 Education 3 Writings 4 Current research 5 Memberships 6 Awards 7 References 8 External links Early life  edit  Bajcsy was born in 1933 in Bratislava , Czechoslovakia to a Jewish family. Although her family was initially spared from Nazi concentration camps due to her fathers work as a civil engineer , most of her adult relatives were killed by the Nazis in late 1944. Bajcsy and her sister, the only survivors in the immediate family, were supported as war orphans by the Red Cross  Bajcsy was later raised in orphanages and in foster care. A strong student in mathematics, she has said that she chose instead to study electrical engineering as a university student because the career prospects for mathematics students at the time led to teaching, which in Communist Eastern Europe required a commitment to Marxist-Leninist ideology that she was unwilling to provide. 1  Education  edit  She obtained Masters and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Slovak Technical University in 1957 and 1967, and an additional Ph.D. in computer science in 1972 from Stanford University . Her thesis was Computer Identification of Textured Visual Scenes, and her advisor was John McCarthy . 3  In 2001, she received an honorary doctorate from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia . From 200305, she was a member of the Presidents Information Technology Advisory Committee. The November 2002 issue of Discover named her to its list of the 50 most important women in science. 4  In 2012, she received honorary doctorate degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and KTH, The Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. 5  Writings  edit  She has written over 225 articles in journals and conference proceedings, 25 book chapters, and 66 technical reports and has been on many editorial boards. Current research  edit  Her current research centers on artificial intelligence  biosystems and computational biology  control , intelligent systems , and robotics  graphics and human-computer interaction , computer vision  and security . Memberships  edit  Bajcsy is a member of the National Academy of Engineering 6  and the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine 7  as well as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery ACM, 8  the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers , 9  the American Association for Artificial Intelligence , 10  and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . 11  Awards  edit  Bajcsy received the Association for Computing Machinery ACMAssociation for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Allen Newell Award in 2001, the ACM Distinguished Service Award in 2003, and the Computing Research Association Distinguished Service Award in 2003. Bajcsys most current research has helped her gain recognition from The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia . Ruzena Bajcsy received the 2009 Benjamin Franklin Medal in Computer and Cognitive Science for her innovations in robotics and computer vision, specifically the development of improved robotic perception and the creation of better methods to analyze medical images. Additionally, she was the winner of the 2009 ABIE Award for Technical Leadership from the Anita Borg Institute . 12  Bajcsy has been named by the IEEE Board of Directors the recipient of the 2013 IEEE Robotics and Automation Award for her contributions in the field of robotics and automation with the following citation For contributions to computer vision, the active perception paradigm, and medical robotics. 13  Bajcsy is featured in the Notable Women in Computing cards. 14  References  edit   a b Bajcsy, Ruzena 9 July 2002.
