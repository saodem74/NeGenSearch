Industrial engineers use specialized knowledge and skills in the mathematical, physical, and social sciences, together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design, to specify, predict, and evaluate the results obtained from systems and processes 1  . From these results, they are able to create new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of labour, materials and machines and also improve the quality and productivity of systems, physical or social 2  3  .

The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the flying shuttle , the spinning jenny , and perhaps most importantly the steam engine generated economies of scale that made Mass production in centralized locations attractive for the first time. The concept of the production system had its genesis in the factories created by these innovations. 4  Specialization of labor  edit  Watts steam engine  Technical University of Madrid  Adam Smiths concepts of Division of Labour and the Invisible Hand of capitalism introduced in his treatise  The Wealth of Nations  motivated many of the technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems. The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the implementation of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of ski lls training for craftsmen. 4  Charles Babbage became associated with Industrial engineering because of the concepts he introduced in his book On the Economy of Machinery and Manufacturers which he wrote as a result of his visits to factories in England and the United States in the early 1800s. The book includes subjects such as the time required to perform a specific task, the effects of subdividing tasks into smaller and less detailed elements, and the advantages to be gained from repetitive tasks. 4  Interchangeable parts  edit  Eli Whitney and Simeon North proved the feasibility of the notion of Interchangeable parts in the manufacture of muskets and pistols for the US Government. Under this system, individual parts were mass-produced to tolerances to enable their use in any finished product. The result was a significant reduction in the need for skill from specialized workers, which eventually led to the industrial environment to be studied later. 4  Pioneers  edit  Frederick Taylor 1856  1915 is generally credited as being the father of the Industrial Engineering discipline. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Stevens University and earned several patents from his inventions. His books, Shop Management and The Principles of Scientific Management which were published in the early 1900s, were the beginning of Industrial Engineering. 5  Improvements in work efficiency under his methods was based on improving work methods, developing of work standards, and reduction in time required to carry out the work. With an abiding faith in the scientific method, Taylors contribution to Time Study sought a high level of precision and predictability for manual tasks. 4  The husband-and-wife team of Frank Gilbreth 1868  1924 and Lillian Gilbreth 1878  1972 was the other cornerstone of the Industrial Engineering movement whose work is housed at Purdue University School of Industrial Engineering. They categorized the elements of human motion into 18 basic elements called therbligs . This development permitted analysts to design jobs without knowledge of the time required to do a job. These developments were the beginning of a much broader field known as human factors or ergonomics. 4  In 1908, the first course on Industrial Engineering was offered as an elective at Pennsylvania State University , which became a separate program in 1909 through the efforts of Hugo Diemer . 6  The first doctoral degree in industrial engineering was awarded in 1933 by Cornell University . In 1912 Henry Laurence Gantt developed the Gantt chart which outlines actions the organization along with their relationships. This chart opens later form familiar to us today by Wallace Clark . With the development of assembly lines , the factory of Henry Ford 1913 accounted for a significant leap forward in the field. Ford reduced the assembly time of a car more than 700 hours to 1.5 hours. In addition, he was a pioneer of the economy of the capitalist welfare welfare capitalism and the flag of providing financial incentives for employees to increase productivity. Comprehensive quality management system  Total quality management or TQM developed in the forties was gaining momentum after World War II and was part of the recovery of Japan after the war. The American Institute of Industrial Engineering was formed in 1948. The early work by F. W. Taylor and the Gilbreths was documented in papers presented to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as interest grew from merely improving machine performance to the performance of the overall manufacturing process most notably starting with the presentation by Henry R. Towne 1844 - 1924 of his paper The Engineer as An Economist 1186. 7  Modern practice  edit  In 1960 to 1975, with the development of decision support systems in supply such as the Material requirements planning MRP, you can emphasize the timing issue inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc. of industrial organization. Israeli scientist Dr. Jacob Rubinovitz installed the CMMS program developed in IAI and Control-Data Israel in 1976 in South Africa and worldwide. In the seventies, with the penetration of Japanese management theories such as Kaizen and Kanban , Japan realized very high levels of quality and productivity. These theories improved issues of quality, delivery time, and flexibility. Companies in the west realized the great impact of Kaizen and started implementing their own Continuous improvement programs. In the nineties, following the global industry globalization process, the emphasis was on supply chain management and customer-oriented business process design. Theory of constraints developed by an Israeli scientist Eliyahu M. Goldratt 1985 is also a significant milestone in the field. Compared to other engineering disciplines  edit  Engineering is traditionally decompositional. To understand the whole, it is first broken into its parts. One then masters the parts and puts them back together, becoming the master of the whole. Industrial and systems engineerings ISE approach is the opposite any one part cannot be understood without the context of the whole. Changes in one part affect the whole, and the r ole of a part is a projection into the whole. In traditional engineering, people understand the parts first, then they can understand the whole. In ISE, they understand the whole first, and then they can understand the role of each part. Also, Industrial engineering considers the human factor and its relation to the technical aspect of the situation and the all of the other factors that influence the entire situation 3  , while other engineering disciplines focus on the design of inanimate objects. Industrial Engineers integrate combinations of people, information, materials, and equipment that produce innovative and efficient organizations. In addition to manufacturing, Industrial Engineers work and consult in every industry, including hospitals, communications, e-commerce, entertainment, government, finance, food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, sports, insurance, sal es, accounting, banking, travel, and transportation. 8  Industrial Engineering is the branch of Engineering most closely related to human resources in that we apply social skills to work with all types of employees, from engineers to salespeople to top management. One of the main focuses of an Industrial Engineer is to improve the working environments of people  not to change the worker, but to change the workplace. 8  All engineers, including Industrial Engineers, take mathematics through calculus and differential equations. Industrial Engineering is different in that it is based on discrete variable math, whereas all other engineering is based on continuous variable math. We emphasize the use of linear algebra and difference equations, as opposed to the use of differential equations which are so prevalent in other engineering disciplines. This emphasis becomes evident in optimization of production systems in which we are sequencing orders, scheduling batches, determining the number of materials handling units, arranging factory layouts, finding sequences of motions, etc. As, Industrial Engineers, we deal almost exclusively with systems of discrete components. 8  Etymology  edit  This section does not cite any sources .

October 2014   Learn how and when to remove this template message  Etymology  edit  While originally applied to manufacturing , the use of industrial in industrial engineering can be somewhat misleading, since it has grown to encompass any methodical or quantitative approach to optimizing how a process, system, or organization operates. In fact, the Industrial in Industrial engineering means the industry in its broadest sense. 9  People have changed the term industrial to broader terms such as Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Industrial Engineering  Operations Research, Industrial Engineering  Management. Sub-disciplines  edit  Industrial engineering has many sub-disciplines, the most common of which are listed below. Although there are industrial engineers who focus exclusively on one of these sub-disciplines, many deal with a combination of them such as Supply Chain and Logistics, and Facilities and Energy Management. 10  11  Facilities Engineering  Energy Management Financial Engineering Human Factors  Safety Engineering Information Systems Engineering  Management Manufacturing Engineering Operations Engineering  Management Main articles Operations engineering and Operations management Operations Research  Optimization Policy Planning Production Engineering Main article Production Engineering Quality  Reliability Engineering Supply Chain Management  Logistics Main articles Supply-chain management and Logistics System Analysis Systems Engineering Systems Simulation Related Disciplines Organization Development  Change Management Behavioral Economics Main article Behavioral economics Education  edit  Industrial engineers study the interaction of human beings with machines, materials, information, procedures and environments in such developments and in designing a technological system. 12  Universities offer degrees at the bachelor, masters, and doctoral level. Undergraduate curriculum  edit  2018 U.S. News undergraduate rankings 13  University Rank Georgia Institute of Technology 1 University of Michigan 2 University of California, Berkeley 3 Purdue University 4 Stanford University 5 University of WisconsinMadison 5 Pennsylvania State University 7 Virginia Tech 8 Massachusetts Institute of Technology 9 Cornell University 10 Northwestern University 10 In the United States, the undergraduate degree earned is the bachelor of science B.S. or bachelor of science and engineering B.S.E. in industrial engineering IE. Variations of the title include Industrial  Operations Engineering IOE, and Industrial  Systems Engineering ISE. The typical curriculum includes a broad math and science foundation spanning chemistry , physics , mechanics i.e., statics, kinematics, and dynamics, materials science , computer science , electronicscircuits, engineering design , and the standard range of engineering mathematics i.e., calculus , linear algebra , differential equations , statistics . For any engineering undergraduate program to be accredited, regardless of concentration, it must cover a largely similar span of such foundational work - which also overlaps heavily with the content tested on one or more engineering licensure exams in most jurisdictions. The coursework specific to IE entails specialized courses in areas such as optimization , applied probability , stochastic modeling, design of experiments , statistical process control , simulation , manufacturing engineering , ergonomics  safety engineering , and engineering economics . Industrial engineering elective courses typically cover more specialized topics in areas such as manufacturing , supply chains and logistics , analytics and machine learning , production systems , human factors and industrial design , and service systems . 14  15  16  17  18  Certain business schools may offer programs with some overlapping relevance to IE, but the engineering programs are distinguished by a much more intensely quantitative focus, required engineering science electives, and the core math and science courses required of all engineering programs.

For example, Turkey focuses on a very technical degree while Denmark, Finland and the United Kingdom have a management focus degree, thus making it less technical. The United States, meanwhile, focuses on case-studies, group problem solving and maintains a balance between the technical and non technical side. 20  Practicing engineers  edit  Traditionally, a major aspect of industrial engineering was planning the layouts of factories and designing assembly lines and other manufacturing paradigms. And now, in lean manufacturing systems, industrial engineers work to eliminate wastes of time, money, materials, energy, and other resources. Examples of where industrial engineering might be used include flow process charting, process mapping, designing an assembly workstation, strategizing for various operational logistics, consulting as an efficiency expert, developing a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex di stribution schemes for materials or products referred to as supply-chain management , and shortening lines or queues  at a bank, hospital, or a theme park. Modern industrial engineers typically use predetermined motion time system , computer simulation especially discrete event simulation , along with extensive mathematical tools for modeling, such as mathematical optimization and queueing theory , and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Industrial engineers also use the tools of data science and machine learning in their work owing to the strong relatedness of these disciplines with the field and the similar technical background required of industrial engineers including a strong foundation in probability theory , linear algebra , and statistics , as well as having coding skills.
