Quality function deployment From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Quality function deployment  QFD  is a method developed in Japan beginning in 1966 to help transform the voice of the customer into engineering characteristics for a product. 1  2  Yoji Akao , the original developer, described QFD as a method to transform qualitative user demands into quantitative parameters, to deploy the functions forming quality, and to deploy methods for achieving the design quality into subsystems and component parts, and ultimately to specific elements of the manufacturing process. 1  The author combined his work in quality assurance and quality control points with function deployment used in value engineering .

QFD is also deployed in quality improvement, quality management, military needs and consumer products. Customer services Applications for Education improvement 5  and services in hotels etc. Fuzziness  edit  The concepts of fuzzy logic have been applied to QFD Fuzzy QFD or FQFD. 9  A review of 59 papers in 2013 by Abdolshah and Moradi found a number of conclusions most FQFD studies were focused on quantitative methods to construct a house of quality matrix based on customer requirements, where the most-employed techniques were based on multiple-criteria decision analysis methods. 9  They noted that there are factors other than the house of quality relevant to product development, and called metaheuristic methods a promising approach for solving complicated problems of FQFD. 9  Derived techniques and tools  edit  The process of quality function deployment QFD is described in ISO 16355-12015. 10  Pugh concept selection can be used in coordination with QFD to select a promising product or service configuration from among listed alternatives. Modular function deployment uses QFD to establish customer requirements and to identify important design requirements with a special emphasis on modularity. There are three main differences to QFD as applied in modular function deployment compared to house of quality 11  The benchmarking data is mostly gone the checkboxes and crosses have been replaced with circles, and the triangular roof is missing. 11  Notes  edit   a b Akao, Yoji 1994.
