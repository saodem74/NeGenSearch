Considered along with Aristotle and Gottlob Frege to be one of the most significant logicians in history, Gdel had an immense effect upon scientific and philosophical thinking in the 20th century, a time when others such as Bertrand Russell , 3  Alfred North Whitehead , 3  and David Hilbert were analyzing the use of logic and set theory to understand the foundations of mathematics pioneered by Georg Cantor . Gdel published his two incompleteness theorems in 1931 when he was 25 years old, one year after finishing his doctorate at the University of Vienna . The first incompleteness theorem states that for any self-consistent recursive axiomatic system powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers for example Peano arithmetic , there are true propositions about the naturals that cannot be proved from the axioms . To prove this theorem, Gdel developed a technique now known as Gdel numbering , which codes formal expressions as natural numbers. He also showed that neither the axiom of choice nor the continuum hypothesis can be disproved from the accepted axioms of set theory , assuming these axioms are consistent. The former result opened the door for mathematicians to assume the axiom of choice in their proofs. He also made important contributions to proof theory by clarifying the connections between classical logic , intuitionistic logic , and modal logic .

The ancestors of Kurt Gdel were often active in Brnns cultural life. For example, his grandfather Joseph Gdel was a famous singer of that time and for some years a member of the Brnner Mnnergesangverein Mens Choral Union of Brnn. 7  Gdel automatically became a Czechoslovak citizen at age 12 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up at the end of World War I . According to his classmate Klepeta , like many residents of the predominantly German Sudetenlnder , Gdel considered himself always Austrian and an exile in Czechoslovakia. 8  In February 1929 he was granted release from his Czechoslovakian citizenship and then, in April, granted Austrian citizenship. 9  When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Gdel automatically became a German citizen at age 32. After World War II 1948, at the age of 42, he became an American citizen. 10  . In his family, young Kurt was known as Herr Warum Mr. Why because of his insatiable curiosity. According to his brother Rudolf, at the age of six or seven Kurt suffered from rheumatic fever  he completely recovered, but for the rest of his life he remained convinced that his heart had suffered permanent damage. Beginning at age four, Gdel suffered from frequent episodes of poor health, which would continue for his entire life. 11  Gdel attended the Evangelische Volksschule , a Lutheran school in Brnn from 1912 to 1916, and was enrolled in the Deutsches Staats-Realgymnasium from 1916 to 1924, excelling with honors in all his subjects, particularly in mathematics, languages and religion. Although Kurt had first excelled in languages, he later became more interested in history and mathematics. His interest in mathematics increased when in 1920 his older brother Rudolf born 1902 left for Vienna to go to medical school at the University of Vienna . During his teens, Kurt studied Gabelsberger shorthand , Goethe s Theory of Colours and criticisms of Isaac Newton , and the writings of Immanuel Kant . Studying in Vienna  edit  At the age of 18, Gdel joined his brother in Vienna and entered the University of Vienna. By that time, he had already mastered university-level mathematics. 12  Although initially intending to study theoretical physics , he also attended courses on mathematics and philosophy. During this time, he adopted ideas of mathematical realism . He read Kant s Metaphysische Anfangsgrnde der Naturwissenschaft , and participated in the Vienna Circle with Moritz Schlick , Hans Hahn , and Rudolf Carnap . Gdel then studied number theory , but when he took part in a seminar run by Moritz Schlick which studied Bertrand Russell s book Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy , he became interested in mathematical logic . According to Gdel, mathematical logic was a science prior to all others, which contains the ideas and principles underlying all sciences. 13  Attending a lecture by David Hilbert in Bologna on completeness and consistency of mathematical systems may have set Gdels life course. In 1928, Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann published Grundzge der theoretischen Logik  Principles of Mathematical Logic , an introduction to first-order logic in which the problem of completeness was posed Are the axioms of a formal system sufficient to derive every statement that is true in all models of the system This problem became the topic that Gdel chose for his doctoral work. In 1929, at the age of 23, he completed his doctoral dissertation under Hans Hahns supervision. In it, he established his eponymous completeness theorem regarding the first-order predicate calculus . He was awarded his doctorate in 1930, and his thesis accompanied by some additional work was published by the Vienna Academy of Science .

The subject of logic has certainly completely changed its nature and possibilities with Gdels achievement.  John von Neumann 14  In 1930 Gdel attended the Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences , held in Knigsberg , 57 September. Here he delivered his incompleteness theorems . 15  Gdel published his incompleteness theorems in ber formal unentscheidbare Stze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme called in English  On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems . In that article, he proved for any computable axiomatic system that is powerful enough to describe the arithmetic of the natural numbers e.g., the Peano axioms or ZermeloFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice , that If a logical or axiomatic formal system is consistent , it cannot be complete . The consistency of axioms cannot be proved within their own system . These theorems ended a half-century of attempts, beginning with the work of Frege and culminating in Principia Mathematica and Hilberts formalism , to find a set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics. In hindsight, the basic idea at the heart of the incompleteness theorem is rather simple. Gdel essentially constructed a formula that claims that it is unprovable in a given formal system. If it were provable, it would be false. Thus there will always be at least one true but unprovable statement. That is, for any computably enumerable set of axioms for arithmetic that is, a set that can in principle be printed out by an idealized computer with unlimited resources, there is a formula that is true of arithmetic, but which is not provable in that system. To make this precise, however, Gdel needed to produce a method to encode as natural numbers statements, proofs, and the concept of provability he did th is using a process known as Gdel numbering . In his two-page paper Zum intuitionistischen Aussagenkalkl 1932 Gdel refuted the finite-valuedness of intuitionistic logic . In the proof, he implicitly used what has later become known as GdelDummett intermediate logic or Gdel fuzzy logic . Mid-1930s further work and U.S. visits  edit  Gdel earned his habilitation at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 he became a Privatdozent unpaid lecturer there. In 1933 Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, and over the following years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Viennas mathematicians. In June 1936, Moritz Schlick , whose seminar had aroused Gdels interest in logic, was assassinated by one of his former students, Johann Nelbck . This triggered a severe nervous crisis in Gdel. 16  He developed paranoid symptoms, including a fear of being poisoned, and spent several months in a sanitarium for nervous diseases. 17  In 1933, Gdel first traveled to the U.S., where he met Albert Einstein , who became a good friend. 18  He delivered an address to the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society . During this year, Gdel also developed the ideas of computability and recursive functions to the point where he was able to present a lecture on general recursive functions and the concept of truth. This work was developed in number theory, using Gdel numbering . In 1934 Gdel gave a series of lectures at the Institute for Advanced Study IAS in Princeton , New Jersey, entitled On undecidable propositions of formal mathematical systems . Stephen Kleene , who had just completed his PhD at Princeton, took notes of these lectures that have been subsequently published. Gdel visited the IAS again in the autumn of 1935. The traveling and the hard work had exhausted him, and the next year he took a break to recover from a depressive episode. He returned to teaching in 1937. During this time, he worked on the proof of consistency of the axiom of choice and of the continuum hypothesis  he went on to show that these hypotheses cannot be disproved from the common system of axioms of set theory. He married Adele Nimbursky ne Porkert, 18991981, whom he had known for over 10 years, on September 20, 1938. Their relationship had been opposed by his parents on the grounds that she was a divorced dancer, six years older than he was. Subsequently, he left for another visit to the United States, spending the autumn of 1938 at the IAS and publishing Consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory, 19  a classic of modern mathematics. In that work he introduced the constructible universe , a model of set theory in which the only sets that exist are those that can be constructed from simpler sets. Gdel showed that both the axiom of choice AC and the generalized continuum hypothesis GCH are true in the constructible universe, and therefore must be consistent with the ZermeloFraenkel axioms for set theory ZF. This result has had considerable consequences for working mathematicians, as it means they can assume the axiom of choice when proving the HahnBanach theorem . Paul Cohen later constructed a model of ZF in which AC and GCH are false together these proofs mean that AC and GCH are independent of the ZF axioms for set theory. Godel spent the spring of 1939 at the University of Notre Dame . 20  Princeton, Einstein, U.S. citizenship  edit  After the Anschluss on 12 March 1938, Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany . Germany abolished the title Privatdozent , so Gdel had to apply for a different position under the new order. His former association with Jewish members of the Vienna Circle, especially with Hahn, weighed against him. The University of Vienna turned his application down. His predicament intensified when the German army found him fit for conscription. World War II started in September 1939. Before the year was up, Gdel and his wife left Vienna for Princeton . To avoid the difficulty of an Atlantic crossing, the Gdels took the Trans-Siberian Railway to the Pacific, sailed from Japan to San Francisco which they reached on March 4, 1940, then crossed the US by train to Princeton. There Gdel accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study IAS, which he had previously visited during 193334. 21  Albert Einstein was also living at Princeton during this time. Gdel and Einstein developed a strong friendship, and were known to take long walks together to and from the Institute for Advanced Study. The nature of their conversations was a mystery to the other Institute members. Economist Oskar Morgenstern recounts that toward the end of his life Einstein confided that his own work no longer meant much, that he came to the Institute merely ... to have the privilege of walking home with Gdel. 22  Gdel and his wife, Adele, spent the summer of 1942 in Blue Hill, Maine , at the Blue Hill Inn at the top of the bay. Gdel was not merely vacationing but had a very productive summer of work. Using Heft 15 volume 15 of Gdels still-unpublished Arbeitshefte working notebooks, John W. Dawson Jr. conjectures that Gdel discovered a proof for the independence of the axiom of choice from finite type theory, a weakened form of set theory, while in Blue Hill in 1942. Gdels close friend Hao Wang supports this conjecture, noting that Gdels Blue Hill notebooks contain his most extensive treatment of the problem. On December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern accompanied Gdel to his U.S. citizenship exam, where they acted as witnesses. Gdel had confided in them that he had discovered an inconsistency in the U.S. Constitution that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friends unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. The judge turned out to be Phillip Forman , who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einsteins own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask Gdel if he thought a dictatorship like the Nazi regime could happen in the U.S. Gdel then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut Gdel off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion. 23  24  Gdel became a permanent member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in 1946. Around this time he stopped publishing, though he continued to work. He became a full professor at the Institute in 1953 and an emeritus professor in 1976. 25  During his many years at the Institute, Gdels interests turned to philosophy and physics. In 1949, he demonstrated the existence of solutions involving closed timelike curves , to Einsteins field equations in general relativity . 26  He is said to have given this elaboration to Einstein as a present for his 70th birthday. 27  His rotating universes would allow time travel to the past and caused Einstein to have doubts about his own theory. His solutions are known as the Gdel metric an exact solution of the Einstein field equation . He studied and admired the works of Gottfried Leibniz , but came to believe that a hostile conspiracy had caused some of Leibnizs works to be suppressed. 28  To a lesser extent he studied Immanuel Kant and Edmund Husserl . In the early 1970s, Gdel circulated among his friends an elaboration of Leibnizs version of Anselm of Canterbury s ontological proof of Gods existence. This is now known as Gdels ontological proof . Awards and honours  edit  Gdel was awarded with Julian Schwinger  the first Albert Einstein Award in 1951, and was also awarded the National Medal of Science , in 1974. 29  Gdel was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ForMemRS in 1968 . 1  He was a Plenary Speaker of the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 30  The Gdel Prize , an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science, is named after him. Gravestone of Kurt and Adele Gdel in the Princeton, N.J., cemetery Later life and death  edit  Later in his life, Gdel suffered periods of mental instability and illness. He had an obsessive fear of being poisoned  he would eat only food that his wife, Adele, prepared for him. Late in 1977, she was hospitalized for six months and could subsequently no longer prepare her husbands food. In her absence, he refused to eat, eventually starving to death. 31  He weighed 29 kilograms 65  lb when he died. His death certificate reported that he died of malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance in Princeton Hospital on January 14, 1978. 32  He was buried in Princeton Cemetery . Adeles death followed in 1981. Personal life  edit  Religious views  edit  Gdel was a convinced theist , in the Christian tradition. 33  He held the notion that God was personal. He believed firmly in an afterlife, stating Of course this supposes that there are many relationships which todays science and received wisdom havent any inkling of. But I am convinced of this the afterlife, independently of any theology. It is possible today to perceive, by pure reasoning that it is entirely consistent with known facts. If the world is rationally constructed and has meaning, then there must be such a thing as an afterlife. 34  In an unmailed answer to a questionnaire, Gdel described his religion as baptized Lutheran but not member of any religious congregation. My belief is theistic , not pantheistic , following Leibniz rather than Spinoza . 35  Describing religions in general, Gdel said Religions are, for the most part, badbut religion is not. 36  According to his wife Adele, Gdel, although he did not go to church, was religious and read the Bible in bed every Sunday morning, 37  while of Islam, he said, I like Islam it is a consistent or consequential idea of religion and open-minded. 38  Legacy  edit  The Kurt Gdel Society , founded in 1987, was named in his honor. It is an international organization for the promotion of research in the areas of logic, philosophy, and the history of mathematics . The University of Vienna hosts the Kurt Gdel Research Center for Mathematical Logic. The Association for Symbolic Logic has invited an annual Kurt Gdel lecturer each year since 1990. Gdels Philosophical Notebooks are edited at the Kurt Gdel Research Centre which is situated at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Germany. Five volumes of Gdels collected works have been published. The first two include Gdels publications the third includes unpublished manuscripts from Gdels Nachlass , and the final two include correspondence. A biography of Gdel was published by John Dawson in 2005 Logical Dilemmas The Life and Work of Kurt Gdel  A. K.

Gdel was also one of four mathematicians examined in the 2008 BBC documentary entitled Dangerous Knowledge by David Malone . 39  Douglas Hofstadter wrote a popular book in 1979 called Gdel, Escher, Bach to celebrate the work and ideas of Gdel, along with those of artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach . The book partly explores the ramifications of the fact that Gdels incompleteness theorem can be applied to any Turing-complete computational system, which may include the human brain .

He was baptized as a Lutheran, and re-mained a theist a believer in a personal God throughout his life.  Hao Wang, A Logical Journey From Gdel to Philosophy, 1996, pp. 10405.  Gdels answer to a special questionnaire sent him by the sociologist Burke Grandjean. This answer is quoted directly in Wang 1987, p.  18, and indirectly in Wang 1996, p.  112. Its also quoted directly in Dawson 1997, p.  6, who cites Wang 1987. The Grandjean questionnaire is perhaps the most extended autobiographical item in Gdels papers. Gdel filled it out in pencil and wrote a cover letter, but he never returned it. Theistic is italicized in both Wang 1987 and Wang 1996. It is possible that this italicization is Wangs and not Gdels. The quote follows Wang 1987, with two corrections taken from Wang 1996. Wang 1987 reads Baptist Lutheran where Wang 1996 has baptized Lutheran. Wang 1987 has rel. cong., which in Wang 1996 is expanded to religious congregation.  Wang 1996 p.  316  Wang 1996, p.  51.  Wang 1996, p.  148, 4.4.3. It is one of Gdels observations, made between 16 November and 7 December 1975, which Wang found hard to classify under the main topics considered elsewhere in the book.  Dangerous Knowledge . BBC.
