Biological systems engineering From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Biological systems engineering or biosystems engineering is a broad-based engineering discipline with particular emphasis on biology and chemistry . It can be thought of as a subset of the broader notion of biological engineering or bio-technology though not in the respects that pertain to biomedical engineering as biosystems engineering tends to focus less on medical applications than on agriculture, ecosystems, and food science . It involves aspects of genetic engineering , particularly regarding the agricultural applications. The discipline focuses broadly on environmentally sound and sustainable engineering solutions to meet societies ecologically-related needs. Biosystems engineering integrates the expertise of fundamental engineering fields with expertise from non-engineering disciplines.

Since biological engineering covers a wide spectrum, many departments now offer specialization options. Depending on the department and the specialization options offered within each program, curricula may overlap with other related fields. There are a number of different titles for BSE-related departments at various universities. The professional societies commonly associated with many Biological Engineering programs include the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers ASABE 3  and the Institute of Biological Engineering IBE, 4  which generally encompasses BSE. Some program also participate in the Biomedical Engineering Society BMES 5  and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE. 6  A biological systems engineer has a background in what both environmental engineers and biologists do, thus bridging the gap between engineering and the non-medical biological sciences  although this is variable across academic institutions.  citation needed  For this reason, biological systems engineers are becoming integral parts of many environmental engineering firms, federal agencies, and biotechnology industries. A biological systems engineer will often address the solution to a problem from the perspective of employing living systems to enact change. For example, biological treatment methodologies can be applied to provide access to clean drinking water 7  or for sequestration of carbon dioxide. 8  Specializations  edit  Land and water resources engineering Food engineering and bioprocess engineering Machinery systems engineering Natural resources and environmental engineering Biomedical engineering Academic programs in agricultural and biological systems engineering  edit  Below is a listing of known academic programs that offer bachelors degrees B.S. or B.S.E. in what ABET terms  agricultural engineering , biological systems engineering,  biological engineering , or similarly named programs.

  For example the Department of Biological Systems Engineering Archived 2004-04-01 at the Wayback Machine at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University was established as agricultural engineering in 1920, and renamed in 1992 to reflect new focus areas in the teaching, research and extension programs.  The Department of Biological Systems Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln began within Mechanical Engineering, awarded its first degree in Agricultural Engineering in 1908, and changed its name to Biological Systems Engineering in 1990. httpengineering.unl.edubsehistory  Website American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers  Website Institute of Biological Engineers  Website Biomedical Engineering Society ,  Website American Institute of Chemical Engineers ,  Website httpwww.jbioleng.orgcontent512 Biological approaches for addressing the grand challenge of providing access to clean drinking water  Website httpwww.jbioleng.orgcontent5114 Addressing the Grand Challenge of atmospheric carbon dioxide geologic sequestration vs. biological recycling Further reading  edit  2003, Dennis R.
