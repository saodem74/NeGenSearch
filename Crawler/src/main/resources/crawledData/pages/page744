Buran spacecraft From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Soviet winged orbital vehicle This article is about the orbiter launched in 1988.

It is, depending on the source, also known as  OK-1K1 ,  Orbiter K1 ,  OK 1.01  or  Shuttle 1.01 . Besides describing the first operational SovietRussian shuttle orbiter, Buran was also the designation for the entire SovietRussian space-plane project and its orbiters, which were known as  Buran -class space-planes. OK-1K1 completed one uncrewed spaceflight in 1988, and was destroyed in 2002 when the hangar it was stored in collapsed. 3  The Buran -class orbiters used the expendable Energia rocket, a class of super heavy-lift launch vehicle .

Construction of a second orbiter  OK-1K2 , informally known as Ptichka  started in 1988. The Buran program ended in 1993. 4  Operational history  edit  Orbiter OK-1K1 Buran during launch on 15 November 1988 Orbital flight  edit  The only orbital launch of a Buran -class orbiter occurred at 030002   UTC on 15 November 1988 from Baikonur Cosmodrome launch pad 11037 . 3  5  Buran was lifted into space, on an uncrewed mission, by the specially designed Energia rocket. The automated launch sequence performed as specified, and the Energia rocket lifted the vehicle into a temporary orbit before the orbiter separated as programmed. After boosting itself to a higher orbit and completing two orbits around the Earth, the ODU  Russian     , ombined propulsion system engines fired automatically to begin the descent into the atmosphere, return to the launch site , and horizontal landing on a runway. 6  After making an automated approach to Site 251 known as Yubileyniy Airfield, 3  Buran touched down under its own control at 062442  UTC and came to a stop at 062524, 7  206 minutes after launch. 8  Despite a lateral wind speed of 61.2 kilometres per hour 38.0  mph, Buran landed only 3 metres 9.8  ft laterally and 10 metres 33  ft longitudinally from the target mark. 8  9  It was the first spaceplane to perform an uncrewed flight, including landing in fully automatic mode. 10  It was later found that Buran had lost only eight of its 38,000 thermal tiles over the course of its flight. 9  Projected flights  edit  In 1989, it was projected that OK-1K1 would have an uncrewed second flight by 1993, with a duration of 1520 days. 11  Although the Buran programme was never officially cancelled, the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to funding drying up and this never took place. 4  Specifications  edit  Size comparison 12  of the Soyuz launch vehicle left, the US Space Shuttle center, and the Buran-Energia right vehicles The mass of the Buran vehicle is quoted as 62 tons 12  , with a maximum payload of 30 tons, for a total lift-off weight of 105 tons 3  4  This section needs additional citations for verification .

Together with the Energia carrier, the Buran vehicle was put in a hangar at the Baikonur Cosmodrome , Kazakhstan . On 12 May 2002, 3  during a severe storm at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the MIK 112 hangar housing OK-1K1 collapsed as a result of poor maintenance. The collapse killed several workers and destroyed the craft as well as the Energia carrier rocket. 13  See also  edit  Spaceflight portal OK-GLI  Buran Analog BST-02 test vehicle Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105  Soviet orbital spaceplane Space Shuttle program United States References  edit   a b c d e f Buran .
