In addition to its archiving function, the Archive is an activist organization, advocating for a free and open Internet. The Internet Archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers , which work to preserve as much of the public web as possible. Its web archive, the Wayback Machine , contains hundreds of billions of web captures. notes 4  4  The Archive also oversees one of the worlds largest book digitization projects.

It has an annual budget of 10 million, derived from a variety of sources revenue from its Web crawling services, various partnerships, grants, donations, and the Kahle-Austin Foundation. 5  Its headquarters are in San Francisco, California . From 1996 to 2009, headquarters were in the Presidio of San Francisco , a former U.S. military base. Since 2009, headquarters have been at 300 Funston Avenue in San Francisco , a former Christian Science Church . At some points in time, most of its staff worked in its book-scanning centers. The Archive has data centers in three Californian cities San Francisco, Redwood City , and Richmond . To prevent losing the data in case of e.g. a natural disaster, the Archive attempts to create copies of parts of the collection at more distant locations, currently including the Bibliotheca Alexandrina notes 5  in Egypt and a facility in Amsterdam . 6  The Archive is a member of the International Internet Preservation Consortium 7  and was officially designated as a library by the state of California in 2007. notes 6  History  edit  2008 headquarters Brewster Kahle founded the archive in May 1996 at around the same time that he began the for-profit web crawling company Alexa Internet . notes 7  In October 1996, the Internet Archive had begun to archive and preserve the World Wide Web in large quantities, notes 8  though it saved the earliest pages in May 1996. 8  9  The archived content wasnt available to the general public until 2001, when it developed the Wayback Machine . In late 1999, the Archive expanded its collections beyond the Web archive, beginning with the Prelinger Archives . Now the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software. It hosts a number of other projects the NASA Images Archive, the contract crawling service Archive-It, and the wiki-editable library catalog and book information site Open Library . Soon after that, the archive began working to provide specialized services relating to the information access needs of the print-disabled publicly accessible books were made available in a protected Digital Accessible Information System DAISY format. notes 9  According to its website notes 10  .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 Most societies place importance on preserving artifacts of their culture and heritage. Without such artifacts, civilization has no memory and no mechanism to learn from its successes and failures. Our culture now produces more and more artifacts in digital form. The Archives mission is to help preserve those artifacts and create an Internet library for researchers, historians, and scholars. In August 2012, the archive announced 10  that it has added BitTorrent to its file download options for more than 1.3 million existing files, and all newly uploaded files. 11  12  This method is the fastest means of downloading media from the Archive, as files are served from two Archive data centers, in addition to other torrent clients which have downloaded and continue to serve the files. 11  notes 11  On November 6, 2013, the Internet Archives headquarters in San Franciscos Richmond District caught fire, 13  destroying equipment and damaging some nearby apartments. 14  According to the Archive, it lost a side-building housing one of 30 of its scanning centers cameras, lights, and scanning equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and maybe 20 boxes of books and film, some irreplaceable, most already digitized, and some replaceable. 15  The nonprofit Archive sought donations to cover the estimated 600,000 in damage. 16  In November 2016, Kahle announced that the Internet Archive was building the Internet Archive of Canada , a copy of the archive to be based somewhere in Canada . The announcement received widespread coverage due to the implication that the decision to build a backup archive in a foreign country was because of the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump . 17  18  19  Kahle was quoted as saying On November 9th in America, we woke up to a new administration promising radical change. It was a firm reminder that institutions like ours, built for the long-term, need to design for change. For us, it means keeping our cultural materials safe, private and perpetually accessible. It means preparing for a Web that may face greater restrictions. It means serving patrons in a wo rld in which government surveillance is not going away indeed it looks like it will increase. Throughout history, libraries have fought against terrible violations of privacywhere people have been rounded up simply for what they read. At the Internet Archive, we are fighting to protect our readers privacy in the digital world. 17  Since 2018, the Internet Archive visual arts residency, which is organized by Amir Saber Esfahani and Andrew McClintock, helps connect artists with the archives over 48 petabytes notes 12  of digitized materials. Over the course of the yearlong residency, visual artists create a body of work which culminates in an exhibition. The hope is to connect digital history with the arts and create something for future generations to appreciate online or off. 20  Previous artists in residence include Taravat Talepasand , Whitney Lynn , and Jenny Odell. In 2019, the main scanning operations were moved to Cebu in the Philippines and were planned to reach a pace of half a million books scanned per year, until an initial target of 4 million books. The Internet Archive acquires most materials from donations, such as a donation of 250 thousand books from Trent University and hundreds thousand 78rpms from Boston Public Library . All material is then digitized and retained in digital storage, while a digital copy is returned to the original holder and the Internet Archives copy, if not in the public domain, is borrowed to patrons worldwide one at a time under the controlled digital lending CDL theory of the first-sale doctrine . 21  Meanwhile in the same year its headquarters in San Francisco received a bomb threat which forced a temporary evacuation of the building. 22  Web archiving  edit  Wayback Machine  edit  Main article Wayback Machine Wayback Machine logo, used since 2001 The Internet Archive capitalized on the popular use of the term  WABAC Machine  from a segment of The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon specifically Peabodys Improbable History , and uses the name Wayback Machine for its service that allows archives of the World Wide Web to be searched and accessed. 23  This service allows users to view some of the archived web pages. The Wayback Machine was created as a joint effort between Alexa Internet and the Internet Archive when a three-dimensional index was built to allow for the browsing of archived web content. notes 13  Millions of web sites and their associated data images, source code, documents, etc. are saved in a database. The service can be used to see what previous versions of web sites used to look like, to grab original source code from web sites that may no longer be directly available, or to visit web sites that no longer even exist. Not all web sites are available because many w eb site owners choose to exclude their sites. As with all sites based on data from web crawlers, the Internet Archive misses large areas of the web for a variety of other reasons. A 2004 paper found international biases in the coverage, but deemed them not intentional. 24  A purchase of additional storage at the Internet Archive The use of the term Wayback Machine in the context of the Internet Archive has become common in popular culture e.g., in the television show Law and Order Criminal Intent Legacy, first run August 3, 2008, a computer tech uses the Wayback Machine to find an archive of a students Facebook -style web site.  citation needed  Snapshots used to take at least 618 months to be added, but sites eventually were able to be added in real time by request.  citation needed  A Save Page Now archiving feature was made available in October 2013, 25  accessible on the lower right of the Wayback Machines main page. notes 14  Once a target URL is entered and saved, the web page will become part of the Wayback Machine. 25  Through the Internet address web.archive.org, 26  users can upload to the Wayback Machine a large variety of contents, including .pdf and data compression file formats. The Wayback Machine creates a permanent local URL of the upload content, that is accessible in the web, even if not listed while searching in the httparchive.org official website. May 12, 1996, is the date of the oldest archived pages on the archive.org WayBack Machine, such as infoseek.com . 27  In October 2016, it was announced that the way web pages are counted would be changed, resulting in the decrease of the archived pages counts shown. 28  Year 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Archived pages billions 40 notes 15  85 notes 16  85 notes 17  85 notes 18  150 notes 19  150 notes 20  150 notes 21  150 notes 22  373 notes 23  430 29  479 notes 24  510 A notes 25  273 B 28  286 notes 26  344 notes 27  A Using the old counting system used before October 2016 B Using the new counting system used after October 2016 Archive-It  edit  Play media Brewster Kahle of the Internet Archive talks about archiving operations Created in early 2006, Archive-It 30  is a web archiving subscription service that allows institutions and individuals to build and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives. Archive-It allows the user to customize their capture or exclusion of web content they want to preserve for cultural heritage reasons. Through a web application, Archive-It partners can harvest, catalog, manage, browse, search, and view their archived collections. 31  In terms of accessibility, the archived web sites are full text searchable within seven days of capture. 32  Content collected through Archive-It is captured and stored as a WARC file . A primary and back-up copy is stored at the Internet Archive data centers. A copy of the WARC file can be given to subscribing partner institutions for geo-redundant preservation and storage purposes to their best practice standards. 33  Periodically, the data captured through Archive-It is indexed into the Internet Archives general archive. As of March  2014 update  , Archive-It had more than 275 partner institutions in 46 U.S. states and 16 countries that have captured more than 7.4 billion URLs for more than 2,444 public collections. Archive-It partners are universities and college libraries, state archives, federal institutions, museums, law libraries, and cultural organizations, including the Electronic Literature Organization , North Carolina State Archives and Library, Stanford University , Columbia University , American University in Cairo , Georgetown Law Library, and many others. Book collections  edit  Text collection  edit  Internet Archive Scribe book scanning workstation The Internet Archive Text Archive collection includes digitized books and special collections from various libraries and cultural heritage institutions from around the world.  citation needed  The Internet Archive operates 33 scanning centers in five countries, digitizing about 1,000 books a day for a total of more than 2 million books, 34  financially supported by libraries and foundations. notes 28  As of July  2013 update  , the collection included 4.4 million books with more than 15 million downloads per month. 34  As of November  2008 update  , when there were approximately 1 million texts, the entire collection was greater than 0.5 petabytes, which includes raw camera images, cropped and skewed images, PDFs , and raw OCR data. 35  Between about 2006 and 2008, Microsoft had a special relationship with Internet Archive texts through its Live Search Books project, scanning more than 300,000 books that were contributed to the collection, as well as financial support and scanning equipment. On May 23, 2008, Microsoft announced it would be ending the Live Book Search project and no longer scanning books. 36  Microsoft made its scanned books available without contractual restriction and donated its scanning equipment to its former partners. 36  An Internet Archive in-house scan ongoing Around October 2007, Archive users began uploading public domain books from Google Book Search . notes 29  As of November  2013 update  , there were more than 900,000 Google-digitized books in the Archives collection notes 30  the books are identical to the copies found on Google, except without the Google watermarks, and are available for unrestricted use and download. 37  Brewster Kahle revealed in 2013 that this archival effort was coordinated by Aaron Swartz , who with a bunch of friends downloaded the public domain books from Google slow enough and from enough computers to stay within Googles restrictions. They did this to ensure public access to the public domain . The Archive ensured the items were attributed and linked back to Google, which never complained, while libraries grumbled. According to Kahle, this is an example of Swartzs genius to work on what could give the most to the public good for millions of people. 38  Besides books, the Archive offers free and anonymous public access to more than four million court opinions, legal briefs, or exhibits uploaded from the United States Federal Courts  PACER electronic document system via the RECAP web browser plugin. These documents had been kept behind a federal court paywall. On the Archive, they had been accessed by more than six million people by 2013. 38  The Archives BookReader web app , 39  built into its website, has features such as single-page, two-page, and thumbnail modes fullscreen mode page zooming of high-resolution images and flip page animation. 39  40  Number of texts for each language  edit  Number of all texts June 2, 2016 10,012,169 notes 31  Language Number of texts November 27, 2015 English 6,553,945 notes 32  French 358,721 notes 33  German 344,810 notes 34  Spanish 134,170 notes 35  Chinese 84,147 notes 36  Arabic 66,786 notes 37  Dutch 30,237 notes 38  Portuguese 25,938 notes 39  Russian 22,731 notes 40  Urdu 14,978 notes 41  Japanese 14,795 notes 42  Number of texts for each decade  edit  XIX century Decade Number of texts November 27, 2015 1800s 39,842 notes 43  1810s 51,151 notes 44  1820s 79,476 notes 45  1830s 105,021 notes 46  1840s 127,649 notes 47  1850s 180,950 notes 48  1860s 210,574 notes 49  1870s 214,505 notes 50  1880s 285,984 notes 51  1890s 370,726 notes 52  XX century Decade Number of texts November 27, 2015 1900s 504,000 notes 53  1910s 455,539 notes 54  1920s 185,876 notes 55  1930s 70,190 notes 56  1940s 85,062 notes 57  1950s 81,192 notes 58  1960s 125,977 notes 59  1970s 206,870 notes 60  1980s 181,129 notes 61  1990s 272,848 notes 62  XXI century Decade Number of texts November 27, 2015 2000s 579,905 notes 63  2010s 855,253 notes 64  Open Library  edit  Main article Open Library The Open Library is another project of the Internet Archive. The wiki seeks to include a web page for every book ever published it holds 25 million catalog records of editions. It also seeks to be a web-accessible public library it contains the full texts of approximately 1,600,000 public domain books out of the more than five million from the main texts collection , as well as in-print and in-copyright books, 41  which are fully readable, downloadable 42  43  and full-text searchable  44  it offers a two-week loan of e-books in its Books to Borrow lending program for over 647,784 books not in the public domain, in partnership with over 1,000 library partners from 6 countries 34  45  after a free registration on the web site. Open Library is a free and open-source software project, with its source code freely available on GitHub . List of digitizing sponsors for ebooks  edit  As of December 2018, over 50 sponsors helped the Internet Archive provide over 5 million scanned books text items. Of these, over 2 million were scanned by Internet Archive itself, funded either by itself or by MSN, the University of Toronto or the Internet Archives founders KahleAustin Foundation . 46  The collections for scanning centers often include also digitisations sponsored by their partners, for instance the University of Toronto performed scans supported by other Canadian libraries.

Upon launch, the service contained 350,000 news programs collected over 3 years from national U.S. networks and stations in San Francisco and Washington D.C. 52  According to Kahle, the service was inspired by the Vanderbilt Television News Archive , a similar library of televised network news programs. 53  In contrast to Vanderbilt, which limits access to streaming video to individuals associated with subscribing colleges and universities, the TV News Search  Borrow allows open access to its streaming video clips. In 2013, the Archive received an additional donation of approximately 40,000 well-organized tapes from the estate of a Philadelphia woman, Marion Stokes . Stokes had recorded more than 35 years of TV news in Philadelphia and Boston with her VHS and Betamax machines. 54  Other services and endeavors  edit  Physical media  edit  An example of another archived item Voicing a strong reaction to the idea of books simply being thrown away, and inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault , Kahle now envisions collecting one copy of every book ever published. Were not going to get there, but thats our goal, he said. Alongside the books, Kahle plans to store the Internet Archives old servers, which were replaced in 2010. 55  Software  edit  The Internet Archive has the largest collection of historical software online in the world, spanning 50 years of computer history in terabytes of computer magazines and journals, books, shareware discs, FTP web sites, video games , etc. The Internet Archive has created an archive of what it describes as vintage software, as a way to preserve them. notes 82  The project advocated for an exemption from the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act to permit them to bypass copy protection , which was approved in 2003 for a period of three years. notes 83  The Archive does not offer the software for download, as the exemption is solely for the purpose of preservation or archival reproduction of published digital works by a library or archive. 56  The exemption was renewed in 2006, and in 2009 was indefinitely extended pending further rulemakings. 57  The Library reiterated the exemption as a Final Rule with no expiration date in 2010. 58  In 2013, the Internet Archive began to provide abandonware video games browser -playable via MESS , for instance the Atari 2600 game E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial . 59  Since December 23, 2014, the Internet Archive presents, via a browser-based DOSBox emulation, thousands of DOS PC games 60  61  notes 84  62  for scholarship and research purposes only . notes 85  63  64  Table Top Scribe System  edit  A combined hardware software system has been developed that performs a safe method of digitizing content. notes 86  65  Credit Union  edit  From 2012 to November 2015, the Internet Archive operated the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union, a federal credit union based in New Brunswick, New Jersey , with the goal of providing access to low- and middle-income people. Throughout its short existence, the IAFCU experienced significant conflicts with the National Credit Union Administration , which severely limited the IAFCUs loan portfolio and concerns over serving Bitcoin firms. At the time of its dissolution, it consisted of 395 members and was worth 2.5 million. 66  67  Controversies and legal disputes  edit  See also Wayback Machine   In legal evidence The main hall of the current headquarters Grateful Dead  edit  In November 2005, free downloads of Grateful Dead concerts were removed from the site. John Perry Barlow identified Bob Weir , Mickey Hart , and Bill Kreutzmann as the instigators of the change, according to an article in The New York Times . 68  Phil Lesh commented on the change in a November 30, 2005, posting to his personal web site It was brought to my attention that all of the Grateful Dead shows were taken down from Archive.org right before Thanksgiving . I was not part of this decision making process and was not notified that the shows were to be pulled. I do feel that the music is the Grateful Deads legacy and I hope that one way or another all of it is available for those who want it. 69  A November 30 forum post from Brewster Kahle summarized what appeared to be the compromise reached among the band members. Audience recordings could be downloaded or streamed, but soundboard recordings were to be available for streaming only. Concerts have since been re-added. notes 87  National security letters  edit  .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerdisplayflexflex-directioncolumn.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowdisplayflexflex-directionrowclearleftflex-wrapwrapwidth100box-sizingborder-box.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglemargin1pxfloatleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theaderclearbothfont-weightboldtext-aligncenteralign-selfcenterbackground-colortransparentwidth100.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-alignleftbackground-colortransparent.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-lefttext-alignleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-righttext-alignright.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-centertext-aligncentermedia all and max-width720px.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerwidth100importantbox-sizingborder-boxmax-widthnoneimportantalign-itemscenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowjustify-contentcenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglefloatnoneimportantmax-width100importantbox-sizingborder-boxtext-aligncenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-aligncenter A national security letter issued to the Internet Archive demanding information about a user On May 8, 2008, it was revealed that the Internet Archive had successfully challenged an FBI national security letter asking for logs on an undisclosed user. 70  71  On November 28, 2016, it was revealed that a second FBI national security letter had been successfully challenged that had been asking for logs on another undisclosed user. 72  Uncensored hosting and terrorism  edit  On August 17, 2011, the Israeli-American Middle East Media Research Institute published  Al-Qaeda , Jihadis Infest the San Francisco, California-Based Internet Archive Library, which detailed how members can post anonymously and enjoy free uncensored hosting. 73  Omni magazine  edit  In a story at his Web site, entitled What the heck is going on at Internet Archive, author Steven Saylor noted Sometime in 2012, the entire run of Omni magazine was uploaded and made available for download at Internet Archive ... Since those old issues must contain hundreds of works still under copyright by numerous contributors, how is this legal 74  At least one contributor to the magazine, author Steve Perry , has publicly complained that he never gave permission for his work to be uploaded they didnt say a word in my direction, 75  and it has been noted that all issues containing the work of Harlan Ellison apparently have been taken down. 76  Glenn Fleishman, investigating the question Who Owns Omni, writes that Almost all of the authors, photographers, and artists whose work appeared in the magazine had signed contracts that granted only short-term rights. ... No one could simply reprint or post the content from older issues. 77  Opposition to SOPA and PIPA bills  edit  The Internet Archive blacked out its web site for 12 hours on January 18, 2012, in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act bills , two pieces of legislation in the United States Congress that they claimed would negatively affect the ecosystem of web publishing that led to the emergence of the Internet Archive. This occurred in conjunction with the English Wikipedia blackout , as well as numerous other protests across the Internet. 78  Opposition to Google Books settlement  edit  The Internet Archive is a member of the Open Book Alliance , which has been among the most outspoken critics of the Google Book Settlement . The Archive advocates an alternative digital library project. 79  Nintendo Power magazine  edit  In February 2016, Internet Archive users had begun archiving digital copies of Nintendo Power , Nintendo s official magazine for their games and products, which ran from 1988 to 2012. The first 140 issues had been collected, before Nintendo had the archive removed on August 8, 2016. In response to the take-down, Nintendo told gaming website Polygon , Nintendo must protect our own characters, trademarks and other content. The unapproved use of Nintendos intellectual property can weaken our ability to protect and preserve it, or to possibly use it for new projects. 80  Government of India  edit  In August 2017, the Government of India blocked the Internet Archive along with other file-sharing websites, citing piracy concerns after copies of two Bollywood films were allegedly shared via the service. 81  The block was lifted subsequently.
