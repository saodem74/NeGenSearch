In recent years these advances have been employed in developing industrial software tools that conduct automated analysis of large industrial codebases. 12  Contents 1 Education 2 Career and research 2.1 Awards and honours 3 References Education  edit  OHearn attained a BSc degree in Computer Science from Dalhousie University , Halifax, Nova Scotia 1985, followed by MSc 1987 and PhD 1991 degrees from Queens University , Kingston , Ontario , Canada. His dissertation was on Semantics of Non-interference A natural approach , supervised by Robert D. Tennent. 13  17  Career and research  edit  OHearn is best known for separation logic , 1  a theory he developed with John C. Reynolds that unearthed new domains for scaling logical reasoning about code. This built upon previous research from OHearn and David Pym on logic for resources  Bunched logic . 2  Separation logic has given rise to the Infer Static Analyzer Facebook Infer, a static program analysis utility developed by OHearns team at Facebook . 3  After 20 plus years in academia, OHearn landed at Facebook in 2013 with the acquisition of Monoidics Ltd, a startup he cofounded. 18  Since its inception, Infer has enabled Facebook engineers to resolve tens of thousands of bugs before reaching production. 19  It was open sourced in 2016, and is used by Amazon Inc , Spotify , Mozilla , Uber , and others. 3  In 2017, OHearn and the team open sourced RacerD, an automated static race condition detection tool that reduces the time it takes to flag potential problems in concurrent software, as part of the Infer platform. 20  OHearn was an Assistant Professor at Syracuse University , New York , United States, from 1990 to 1995. He was a Reader in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London from 1996 to 1999 and then a full professor at Queen Mary until his move to University College London . At UCL he was granted a Royal Academy of Engineering  Microsoft Research Chair. 21  In 1997 he was a Visiting Scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and in 2006 he was a Visiting Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge . 17  . He now shares his time working as a research scientist at Facebook and a professor at UCL. Awards and honours  edit  In 2007, OHearn was granted a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award . 7  In 2011, OHearn and Samin Ishtiaq were awarded a Most Influential POPL Paper Award. 11  With Stephen Brookes, Carnegie Mellon University , he was co-recipient of the 2016 Gdel Prize , for the invention of Concurrent Separation Logic. 8  Also in 2016, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering FREng and co-received the annual CAV Computer Aided Verification award. 9  10  In 2018, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society FRS, and was bestowed with an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Dalhousie University . 6  7  5  . January 2019 saw OHearn honoured with another Most Influential POPL Paper Award, which he shared with three colleagues. 4  References  edit   a b Reynolds, John C. 2002.
