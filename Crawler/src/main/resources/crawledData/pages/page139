They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like Category XYZ  in its wikimarkup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ . Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships. Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page. Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles or other pages that have been added to that particular category. There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category. The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation. The term category does refer to both the title of a category pagethe category pagename and the category itself. Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques. See also the search box parameter  incategory . The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below.

To add a page to a category, include  Category Category name   or  Category Category name  Sortkey   in that pages wikimarkup . The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page. A category is usually associated with a category page in the Category namespace . 1  A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links. Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories . The bottom of a Wikipedia article on Chicken eyeglasses . At the very bottom of the page, below the References, navigation templates and external links are a series of links. These links are the categories used on the page, which include CategoryAnimal Welfare , CategoryAnimal equipment , CategoryEyewear , and CategoryPoultry farming . By clicking on the category link at the bottom of the page, readers can navigate the Category tree. Category page definition A category page is any page in the Category namespace. They each act as a category, and are termed a category. The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other categories, and one section titled Pages , listing pages as categorized in other namespaces. New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace. A category page can be edited like any other page. However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows First a count and list of subcategories other category pages belonging to the category is shown, if any exist. The name of each subcategory is followed by a count of its own subcategories. These further subcategories are expanded in the display if the  sign alongside the subcategory is clicked but this  widget  is only visible if your browser has JavaScript enabled. Note  is shown if there are no further subcategories. The subcategory is collapsed again if  is clicked. Next a count and list of pages in the category excluding subcategories and images is shown. If the category has no members, a message to that effect is displayed. Next a count and list of image and other media files in the category appears, if any exist. These are shown with thumbnails. The first 20 characters of the file name are shown, with an ellipsis if that is not the full name also the file size is shown. The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it the name of the image. For the way in which the lists are ordered, see Sorting category pages below. The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key. These initial characters are displayed above the sections. To suppress these, make all sort keys start with a space. A category page can only display a limited number of items currently 200. If more pages belong to the category, there will be a link to the next ones. The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages. This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e. its parent categories the categories of which it is a subcategory. Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the Category Category name  or Category Category name  Sortkey  syntax. Putting pages into categories A page belongs to a category if the pages wikimarkup contains a declaration for that category. A category declaration takes the form Category Category name  or Category Category name  Sortkey  . The declaration must be processed, i.e. it will not work if it appears between nowiki ...  nowiki  or includeonly ...  includeonly  tags, or in a comment. The declaration may however come from a transcluded page see Categories and templates below. A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate page title . If the category name begins with a lower-case letter it will be capitalized. In Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wikimarkup, but before any stub templates which themselves transclude categories and interlanguage links . When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page or possibly elsewhere, if a non-default skin is being used. This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wikimarkup. The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages. They appear as redlinks if the corresponding category page does not exist. If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page. Hidden categories are not displayed, except as described below under Hiding categories . Working with category pages The following subsections are ordered from simple actions to more elaborate or rarer actions. Linking to category pages To link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon Category Category name . Such a link can be piped like a normal wikilink. The   cl   template, and others listed on its documentation page, may sometimes be helpful. Retrieving raw category information Raw information about the members of a category, their sortkeys and timestamps time when last added to the category can be obtained from the API , using a query of the form httpen.wikipedia.orgwapi.phpcmtitleCategory Category_name actionquery listcategorymembers cmlimit500 cmproptitlesortkeytimestamp Listings of up to 500 members are possible. If there are more members then the results will include text near the end like this categorymembers cmcontinue pageNNNNTITLE    . This can be added to the previous one, without quotation marks, for the next page of members ... cmcontinuepageNNNNTITLE Sorting category pages By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace. English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with , , , will be listed under heading A. Sorting is case-insensitive, so ABC comes after Abacus. Unlike at SpecialAllpages and SpecialPrefixindex , a space is treated as a space coming before all other characters, not as an underscore. The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories . This means a page whose title begins with a number will be sorted according to the numeric value of the number even if it is multiple digits. Thus 9 dogs, 25 dogs, and 112 dogs will all appear under the 09 heading in numeric order. If the number includes a comma, space, or period, the sorting algorithm will only consider the part of the number before the separator. Each of the three lists subcategories, pages, media files is arranged in the order explained above except that, in the subcategories list, the namespace indicator Category is not considered. If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name sort key for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list Category Category name  Sortkey  For example, to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category People and have the article sorted by Einstein, Albert, you would type CategoryPeopleEinstein, Albert Unlike a piped link which uses the same syntax, the sort key itself is not displayed to readers. It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page. It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page. For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WPSORTKEY . Default sort key Shortcut WPDEFAULTSORT See also WPNAMESORT and WPSORTKEY It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from PAGENAME by using the magic word DEFAULTSORT  DEFAULTSORTnew key In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags. This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also hidden included by another template. Searching for pages in categories Further information HelpSearching   Syntax See also   Searching for articles in categories , WikipediaCategory intersection , and Wikimedia bug T3497 Hierarchical category system is urgently needed In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories. To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory CategoryName  in the search box. An OR can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another. For example, enter incategorySuspension bridges OR incategoryBridges in New York City to return all pages that belong to either or both of the categories, as here . Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates. This feature also doesnt return pages in subcategories. Listing all categories SpecialCategories provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one. The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages. To list all existing category pages regardless of whether they have members, use SpecialAllPagesCategory . Displaying category trees and page counts As described at mwHelpMagic words , PAGESINCATEGORY Example  or PAGESINCAT Example  returns the number of pages in CategoryExample. Each subcategory counts as one page pages in subcategories are not counted. The page SpecialCategoryTree enables you to see the tree structure of a category its subcategories, their subcategories and so on the display of files and other member pages is optional. The CategoryTree extension can be used to display such a tree on any page. This is sometimes done on the category page itself, if the category is split over multiple screens, to make all subcategories available on every screen. The basic syntax is categorytree  Category name categorytree  to display just the subcategory tree, and categorytree modepages  Category name categorytree  to display member pages as well. They will be indicated by italics. Dapetes category-visualizer vCat will render charts of the tree structure. You may also use TemplateCategory tree or TemplateCategory tree all , instead. Warning The following code PAGESINCATEGORYPAGENAME will not work as expected when used in the wikitext or in a transcluded template in a category page whose title contains some ASCII punctuations. For legacy reasons, PAGENAME may return the page name with these characters being HTML-encoded using numeric character entities   this still works for generating derived wikilinks or displaying page names, or when HTML-encoded this page name is used in a conditional switch, but PAGESINCATEGORY does not recognize the category name given in parameter if some characters are HTML-encoded this is the case notably when the category name contains ASCII apostrophes  and a few other ASCII punctuations. The same HTML-encoding is also applied to the values returned by FULLPAGENAME , SUBPAGENAME , or NAMESPACE . In that case, as the category is not found by its HTML-encoded pagename, PAGESINCATEGORY will unexpectedly return 0 and not its effective number of member pages. A simple workaround is to transform these HTML-encoded characters back into standard UTF-8-encoded characters, by using the titleparts parser function, like this PAGESINCATEGORYtitlepartsPAGENAME Moving and redirecting category pages Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary. A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal REDIRECT  ... but a  category redirect  . Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted. For categories entirely populated through templates see above, modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned. Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at WikipediaCategories for discussion . Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a  category redirect  template. See WikipediaCategories for discussionRedirecting categories for more on category redirects. Hiding categories When the magic word __HIDDENCAT__ is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden , meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category. On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the   hidden category   template. The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages. However, hidden categories are displayed although listed as hidden on category pages whether as parent categories or subcategories at preview during editing if the user has selected Show hidden categories in user preferences. Hidden categories are automatically added to CategoryHidden categories . For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see WPHIDDENCAT . Finding articles for a category The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the  What links here -tool on the categorys main article. An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant list and checking its entries. Sometimes categories are about things that are intersections of other categories for which the PetScan tool can be used. More relevant articles may also be found linked in a categorys main article and the articles already featured in the category  especially in their See also sections if existent and the automatically suggested RELATED ARTICLES below them. Furthermore, a categorys superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category. Other ways to find relevant articles include searching Wikipedia for the categorys topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes  with synonyms also in quotes and appended after an OR  and appending the word wiki or Wikipedia or siteWikipedia.org to them. Categorizing Main page WikipediaCategorization Categorizing templates Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that Category Some-topic templates should be placed on the templates documentation page or inside noinclude ...  noinclude  tags, if there is no documentation page, this is necessary to avoid categorizing pages by template inclusion see below. Categories and templates A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside includeonly  includeonly  tags on the template e.g. includeonly Categorycategory name includeonly  . When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page. This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories. Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page. When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved. When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load. This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list. Performing a null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached. To add the template itself to the category page as well, omit the includeonly tags. To add the template to a category without categorizing pages on which the template is transcluded, place the category declaration between noinclude ... noinclude  tags, or add it to the template documentation page between includeonly  includeonly  the latter allows recategorizing the template without editing it, which is helpful if it is protected, or so complicated that mere mortals hesitate to touch it. Parser functions can be used to make the transcluded categories, or the sort key used in them, dependent on other variables, notably PAGENAME. Passing a category name as a parameter includeonly Categorycatdefault includeonly  or includeonly catCategorydefault includeonly  If the user provides a parameter catXXX the page will be categorized at the page CategoryXXX , otherwise it will be categorized at the page Categorydefault . Calling the template with cat equal to nothing disables putting the page in any category. Excluding non-article pages includeonly ifNAMESPACE   CategoryXXX includeonly  the variable NAMESPACE is null for mainspace articles. For any space other than mainspace, this ParserFunction will produce an empty string, but for regular articles this will include the article in CategoryXXX. On Wikipedia it is not recommended that templates be used to populate ordinary content categories of articles. See Categorization using templates in the categorization guideline. Categorizing redirect pages Main page WikipediaCategorizing redirects Redirect pages can be categorized and there are conventions how to do it. The redirect link must be first on the page. On a category page, redirects are listed in italics. Related Changes with categories For a category, the  Related Changes  feature, when applied to the corresponding category page, lists recent changes to the pages which are currently listed as belonging to a category. Where those pages are subcategories or image pages, only changes to their editable parts are listed. Notice that Related Changes does not show edits to pages that have been removed from the category. Also, Related Changes does not list recent changes to pages linked from the editable part of the category page as it would normally, with a non-category page. If a workaround would be required, the links in question could be placed in a template and transcluded onto the category page. As usual  unlike with watchlists  recent changes to corresponding talk pages are not shown under Related Changes. Pages one is watching are bolded on the list. This can help to find which pages in a given category one has on ones watchlist. The DynamicPageList third-party extension provides a list of last edits to the pages in a category, or optionally, just the list of pages the simpler DynamicPageList Wikimedia is installed on Meta, Wikinews, Wikibooks and Wikiversity the extension mwExtensionDPLforum is installed on Wikia. Watching category additions and removals Since 2016 , additions and removals from categories are available via the Category changes filter on recent changes pages, including watchlists and SpecialRecentChangesLinked . For example, category changes to articles in CategoryCannabis stubs can be found here . You can monitor additions and removals from specific categories by adding the categories to your watchlist and making sure the Category changes filter is active. You can view changes to categories in your watchlist by clicking here . Additional scripts with similar functionality are UserCategoryWatchlistBot and UserAis523catwatch . See also MWHelpCategories   Category TOC   WikipediaFAQCategorization WikipediaWikiProject Categories WikipediaQuick cat index Notes  The category itself is permanently created as soon as it has been saved on to any page. Unless you create a category page , it will display as a red link. Unless you add another category to the category page, it will not be placed in the category tree. Category pages are created like any other page. Most commonly, editors click on the redlink in an article and create the category page that way. v t e Wikipedia help pages Visit the Teahouse if you are a new editor looking for interactive help, or the Help desk for an interactive Q  A forum.
