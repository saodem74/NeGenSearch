Laws applied  101 of the Patent Act of 1952 Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63 1972, was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that a process claim directed to a numerical algorithm , as such, was not patentable because the patent would wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself. 1  That would be tantamount to allowing a patent on an abstract idea, contrary to precedent dating back to the middle of the 19th century. The ruling stated Direct attempts to patent programs have been rejected and indirect attempts to obtain patents and avoid the rejection ... have confused the issue further and should not be permitted. 2  The case was argued on October 16, 1972 and was decided November 20, 1972. Contents 1 Prior history 2 The case 3 Impact 4 Notes 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading 8 External links Prior history  edit  The case revolves around a patent application filed by inventors Gary Benson and Arthur Tabbot, 3  for a method for converting binary-coded decimal BCD numerals into pure binary numerals on a general purpose digital computer. The patent examiner at the United States Patent Office, now called the United States Patent and Trademark Office or PTO, rejected the patent application as being directed to a mathematical expression. Pure mathematical expressions had been held to be unpatentable under earlier patent laws in Mackay Co. v. Radio Corp. 4  The applicant appealed to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences . The Board affirmed the examiners rejection. The applicant further appealed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals . The Court reversed the Board. Finally, Commissioner of Patents Robert Gottschalk filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. The case  edit  The law which is applicable to this case is section 101 of the Patent Act of 1952 . 1 The question was whether or not the claimed invention was a process under the law. The Court held that because the claim was not limited to any particular type of programmable digital computer and neither involved special purpose implementing machinery nor a transformation of substances, as in all prior cases holding processes patentable, the claim would effectively preclude use of the method for any currently known or future invention in any field. Thus the claim was directed to an algorithm alone and therefore was not patentable. The Government, in its brief to the Supreme Court, asked the Court to hold that no process could be patented unless it claimed either a transformation of substances or was implemented with a newly devised machine. The Court held that those criteria were clues to paten t-eligibility but declined to hold that they were necessary conditions for patent-eligibility in all cases, even though every case in which the Supreme Court had approved a process patent thus far had involved such a process. Impact  edit  This decision was widely seen as confirming that software by itself was not directly patentable. What patent attorneys agents had been doing in the meantime, however, was to get patent protection on software inventions by claiming the algorithm in combination with the general purpose digital computer programmed to carry out the algorithm. Thus they technically purported to be claiming a new machine and this, the lower patent court held, was patentable. 2  The boundary between when a computer implemented process is purely an abstract idea and thus not patentable and when it is a process implementing the idea in a practical way and thus is patentable is still a matter of debate within the US patent office. The Supreme Court has not been clear . . . . . . as to whether such subject matter is excluded from the scope of 101 bec ause it represents laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas. 5  It also remains a contested issue whether process patent claims must be directed to a transformation of substances or else embody a nontrivial, novel implementing machine or device. The PTO has taken this position in its arguments to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. See USPTO brief in In re Bilski . 6  The Government also so argued in briefing the Benson case. 7  The majority opinion in the Federal Circuits opinion in In re Bilski adopts this position. Notes  edit   35 U.S.C. 101 says, Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title. 35 U.S.C. 100b gives the definition for process, The term process means process, art or method, and includes a new us e of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material. 2 See also  edit  List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 409 Software patent CyberSource Corp. v.
