With a population of over 327  million people, the U.S. is the third most populous country . The capital is Washington, D.C. , and the most populous city is New York City . Most of the country is located contiguously in North America between Canada and Mexico . Paleo-Indians migrated from Siberia to the North American mainland at least 12,000 years ago. 20  European colonization began in the 16th century. The United States emerged from the thirteen British colonies established along the East Coast . Following the French and Indian War , numerous disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution , which began in 1775, and the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war ended in 1783 with the United States becoming the first country to gain independence from a colonial empire . 21  The current constitution was adopted in 1788, with the first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights , being ratified in 1791 to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties . The United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century, acquiring new territories , 22  displacing Native American tribes , and gradually admitting new states until it spanned the continent by 1848. 22  During the second half of the 19th century, the Civil War led to the abolition of slavery . 23  24  By the end of the century, the United States had reached the Pacific Ocean, 25  and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution , began to soar. 26  The SpanishAmerican War and World War I confirmed the countrys status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower , the first country to develop nuclear weapons , the only country to use them in warfare , and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council . Sweeping civil rights legislation passed under President Lyndon B. Johnson , notably the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 , outlawed discrimination based on race or color and established the country as a full liberal democracy . 27  During the Cold War , the United States and the Soviet Union competed in the Space Race , culminating with the 1969 U.S. Moon landing . The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the worlds sole superpower. 28  The United States is the worlds oldest surviving federation . It is a federal republic and a representative democracy . The United States is a founding member of the United Nations , World Bank , International Monetary Fund , Organization of American States OAS, and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country , with the worlds largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP , accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. 29  The U.S. economy is largely post-industrial , characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. 30  The United States is the worlds largest importer and the second-largest exporter of goods, by value. 31  32  Although its population is only 4.3 of the world total, 33  the U.S. holds 31 of the total wealth in the world , the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. 34  Despite income and wealth disparities , the United States continues to rank very high in measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage , median income both before and after taxes and transfers, human development , per capita GDP , and worker productivity. 35  36  The United States is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending , 37  and is a leading political , cultural , and scientific force internationally. 38  Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history 2.2 Effects on and interaction with native populations 2.3 European settlements 2.4 Independence and expansion 17761865 2.5 Civil War and Reconstruction era 2.6 Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization 2.7 World War I, Great Depression, and World War II 2.8 Cold War and civil rights era 2.9 Contemporary history 3 Geography, climate, and environment 3.1 Wildlife 4 Demographics 4.1 Population 4.1.1 Major population areas 4.2 Language 4.3 Religion 4.4 Family structure 4.5 Health 4.6 Education 4.6.1 Higher education 5 Government and politics 5.1 Political divisions 5.2 Parties and elections 5.3 Foreign relations 5.4 Government finance 5.5 Military 6 Law enforcement and crime 7 Economy 7.1 Science and technology 7.2 Income, poverty and wealth 8 Infrastructure 8.1 Transportation 8.2 Energy 8.3 Water supply and sanitation 9 Culture 9.1 Food 9.2 Literature, philosophy, and visual art 9.3 Music 9.4 Cinema 9.5 Sports 9.6 Mass media 10 See also 11 Notes 12 References 13 Further reading 14 External links Etymology See also Naming of the Americas , Names for United States citizens , and American word The Americas are believed to be named for the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci . 39  In 1507, the German cartographer Martin Waldseemller produced a world map on which he named the lands of the Western Hemisphere America in honor of the Italian explorer and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci  Latin  Americus Vespucius . 40  The first documentary evidence of the phrase United States of America is from a letter dated January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan , Esq., to George Washington s aide-de-camp and Muster-Master General of the Continental Army , Lt. Col. Joseph Reed . Moylan expressed his wish to go with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain to seek assistance in the revolutionary war effort. 41  42  43  The first known publication of the phrase United States of America was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, Virginia, on April 6, 1776. 44  The second draft of the Articles of Confederation , prepared by John Dickinson and completed by June 17, 1776, at the latest, declared The name of this Confederation shall be the United States of America  . 45  The final version of the Articles sent to the states for ratification in late 1777 contains the sentence The Stile of this Confederacy shall be The United States of America  . 46  In June 1776, Thomas Jefferson wrote the phrase UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in all capitalized letters in the headline of his original Rough draught of the Declaration of Independence . 45  This draft of the document did not surface until June 21, 1776, and it is unclear whether it was written before or after Dickinson used the term in his June 17 draft of the Articles of Confederation. 45  The short form United States is also standard. Other common forms are the U.S., the USA, and America. Colloquial names are the U.S. of A. and, internationally, the States.  Columbia , a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from Christopher Columbus  it appears in the name  District of Columbia , many landmarks and institutions in the Western Hemisphere bear his name, including the country of Colombia . 47  The phrase United States was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent statese.g., the United States areincluding in the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , ratified in 1865. 48  The singular forme.g., the United States isbecame popular after the end of the American Civil War. The singular form is now standard the plural form is retained in the idiom these United States. The difference is more significant than usage it is a difference between a collection of states and a unit. 49  A citizen of the United States is an  American . United States, American and U.S. refer to the country adjectivally American values, U.S.  forces. In English, the word  American  rarely refers to topics or subjects not directly connected with the United States. 50  History Main articles History of the United States , Timeline of United States history , American business history , Economic history of the United States , and Labor history of the United States Indigenous peoples and pre-Columbian history Further information Native Americans in the United States .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerdisplayflexflex-directioncolumn.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowdisplayflexflex-directionrowclearleftflex-wrapwrapwidth100box-sizingborder-box.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglemargin1pxfloatleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theaderclearbothfont-weightboldtext-aligncenteralign-selfcenterbackground-colortransparent width100.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-alignleftbackground-colortransparent.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-lefttext-alignleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-righttext-alignright.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-centertext-aligncentermedia all and max-width720px.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerwidth100importantbox-sizi ngborder-boxmax-widthnoneimportantalign-itemscenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowjustify-contentcenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglefloatnoneimportantmax-width100importantbox-sizingborder-boxtext-aligncenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-aligncenter Monks Mound , in Cahokia , a UNESCO World Heritage Site The Cliff Palace , built by the Ancestral Puebloans It has been generally accepted that the first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 12,000 years ago however, increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. 20  51  52  After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward along the Pacific coast 53  and through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. 54  The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas. 55  The Clovis culture was believed to represent the first human settlement of the Americas. 56  Over the years, more and more evidence has advanced the idea of pre-Clovis cultures including tools dating back about 15,550 years ago. It is likely these represent the first of three major waves of migrations into North America. 57  Over time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly complex, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, grand architecture, and state-level societies. 58  The Mississippian culture flourished in the south from 800 to 1600 AD, extending from the Mexican border down through Florida. 59  Its city state Cahokia is considered the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in the modern-day United States. 60  In the Four Corners region, Ancestral Puebloans culture developed as the culmination of centuries of agricultural experimentation, which produced greater dependence on farming. 61  Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the United States are credited to the Pueblos Mesa Verde National Park , Chaco Culture National Historical Park , and Taos Pueblo . 62  63  The earthworks constructed by Native Americans of the Poverty Point culture in northeastern Louisiana have also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the southern Great Lakes region, the Iroquois Confederacy Haudenosaunee was established at some point between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. 64  The date of the first settlements of the Hawaiian Islands is a topic of continuing debate. 65  Archaeological evidence seems to indicate a settlement as early as 124 AD. 66  Effects on and interaction with native populations Further information American Indian Wars , Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas , and Native American disease and epidemics With the progress of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced . 67  The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles . 68  69  While estimating the original native population of North America at the time of European contact is difficult, an attempt was made in the early part of the twentieth century by James Mooney using historic records to estimate the indigenous population north of Mexico in 1600. 70  71  In more recent years, Douglas H. Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution has updated these figures. 72  While Ubelaker estimated that there was a population of 92,916 in the south Atlantic states and a population of 473,616 in the Gulf states, most academics regard the figure as too low. 70  Anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns believed that the populations were much higher, suggesting 1,100,000 along the shores of the gulf of Mexico, 2,211,000 people living between Florida and Massachusetts , 5,250,000 in the Mississippi Valley and tributaries and 697,000 people in the Florida peninsula . 70  71  The first interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was made by the Norsemen . A number of surviving Norse sagas provide information regarding The Maritimes and its indigenous people. The Norse attempted to settle in North America about 500 years before Columbus. 73  74  75  In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars . At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares. 76  Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans, and squash. European missionaries and others felt it was important to civilize the Native Americans and urged them to adopt European agricultural techniques and lifestyles. 77  78  European settlements Further information Colonial history of the United States , European colonization of the Americas , and Thirteen Colonies St. Augustine, Florida , the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the continental United States 1565 79  The Mayflower Compact , 1620 by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris With the advancement of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced . 80  The first Europeans to arrive in the territory of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan Ponce de Len , who made his first visit to Florida in 1513 however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage . The Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine 79  and Santa Fe . The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River . Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom . The continents first elected legislative assembly, Virginias House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact , signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut , established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies. 81  82  Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. Cash crops included tobacco, rice, and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period, Americans were producing one-seventh of the worlds iron supply. 83  Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of Scotch-Irish and other groups. As coastal land grew more expensive, freed indentured servants pushed further west. 84  A large-scale slave trade with English privateers was begun. 85  The life expectancy of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase in the numbers of slaves. 86  87  Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery, and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. 88  89  But by the turn of the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions. 90  With the British colonization of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies that would become the United States of America were established. 91  All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen and a sense of self-government stimulating support for republicanism. 92  With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. 93  The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and religious liberty. 94  The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748 During the Seven Years War in the United States, known as the French and Indian War , British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone population remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans , who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the rate of natural increase was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. 95  The colonies distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek to reassert royal authority. 96  In 1774, the Spanish Navy ship Santiago , under Juan Prez , entered and anchored in an inlet of Nootka Sound , Vancouver Island, in present-day British Columbia. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California . 97  At the time, the Spanish were able to monopolize the trade between Asia and North America, granting limited licenses to the Portuguese . When the Russians began establishing a growing fur trading system in Alaska , the Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Prezs voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest . 98  j  During his third and final voyage , Captain James Cook became the first European to begin formal contact with Hawaii. 100  Captain Cooks last voyage included sailing along the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. 101  Independence and expansion 17761865 Further information American Revolutionary War , United States Declaration of Independence , American Revolution , and Territorial evolution of the United States Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of  republicanism  asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their rights as Englishmen and no taxation without representation. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and the conflict escalated into war. 102  The Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, which recognized, in a long preamble, that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the thirteen United Colonies formed an independent nation and had no further allegiance to the British crown. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as Independence Day . 103  The Second Continental Congress declared on September 9 where, heretofore, the words United Colonies have been used, the stile be altered for the future to the United States . 104  In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak government that operated until 1789. 103  U.S. territorial acquisitions portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century. Following the defeat at Yorktown in 1781, 105  Britain signed the peace treaty of 1783 , and American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River . Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution , ratified in state conventions in 1788. The federal government was reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington , who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights , forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791. 106  Although the federal government criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South , and along with it, the slave population. 107  108  109  The Second Great Awakening , especially 18001840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism  110  in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations. 111  Map of the states and territories of the United States, c. 1834 Americans eagerness to expand westward prompted a long series of American Indian Wars . 112  The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nations area. 113  The War of 1812 , declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. 114  A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. 115  The expansion was aided by steam power , when steamboats began traveling along Americas large water systems, which were connected by new canals , such as the Erie and the I M  then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nations land. 116  From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian democracy began a set of reforms which included wider white male suffrage it led to the rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. The Trail of Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations . The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny . 117  The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest . 118  Victory in the MexicanAmerican War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest . 119  The national mammal , an American bison in Yellowstone National Park , Wyoming The California Gold Rush of 184849 spurred western migration, the California Genocide 120  121  122  123  and the creation of additional western states. 124  After the American Civil War , new transcontinental railways made relocation easier for settlers, expanded internal trade and increased conflicts with Native Americans. 125  Over a half-century, the loss of the American bison sometimes called buffalo was an existential blow to many Plains Indians culture. 126  In 1869, a new Peace Policy nominally promised to protect Native-Americans from abuses, avoid further war, and secure their eventual U.S. citizenship. Nonetheless, large-scale conflicts continued throughout the West into the 1900s. Civil War and Reconstruction era Further information American Civil War and Reconstruction era The Battle of Gettysburg by Thure de Thulstrup Differences of opinion regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans ultimately led to the American Civil War . 127  Initially, states entering the Union had alternated between slave and free states , keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery. 128  With the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln , the first president from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party , conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America the South, while the federal government the  Union  maintained that secession was illegal. 128  In order to bring about this secession, military action was initiated by the secessionists, and the Union responded in kind. The ensuing war would become the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians. 129  The South fought for the freedom to own slaves, while the Union at first simply fought to maintain the country as one united whole. Nevertheless, as casualties mounted after 1863 and Lincoln delivered his Emancipation Proclamation , the main purpose of the war from the Unions viewpoint became the abolition of slavery. Indeed, when the Union ultimately won the war in April 1865, each of the states in the defeated South was required to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment , which prohibited slavery. Three amendments were added to the U.S. Constitution in the years after the war the aforementioned Thirteenth as well as the Fourteenth Amendment providing citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves, 130  and the Fifteenth Amendment ensuring in theory that African Americans had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in federal power 131  aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the South while guaranteeing the rights of the newly freed slaves. Reconstruction began in earnest following the war. While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, an assassins bullet on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans. They persisted until the Compromise of 1877 when the Republicans agreed to cease protecting the rights of African Americans in the South in order for Democrats to concede the presidential election of 1876 . Southern white Democrats, calling themselves  Redeemers , took control of the South after the end of Reconstruction. From 1890 to 1910, so-called Jim Crow laws disenfranchised most blacks and some poor whites throughout the region. Blacks faced racial segregation , especially in the South. 132  They also occasionally experienced vigilante violence, including lynching . 133  Ellis Island , in New York City, was a major gateway for European immigration . 134  The Statue of Liberty in New York City, dedicated in 1886, is a symbol of the United States as well as its ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice. 135  Further immigration, expansion, and industrialization Main articles Economic history of the United States and Technological and industrial history of the United States In the North, urbanization and an unprecedented influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the countrys industrialization and transformed its culture. 136  National infrastructure including telegraph and transcontinental railroads spurred economic growth and greater settlement and development of the American Old West . The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life. 137  The United States fought Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River from 1810 to at least 1890. 138  Most of these conflicts ended with the cession of Native American territory and the confinement of the latter to Indian reservations . This further expanded acreage under mechanical cultivation, increasing surpluses for international markets. 139  Mainland expansion also included the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. 140  In 1893, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy and formed the Republic of Hawaii , which the U.S. annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico , Guam , and the Philippines were ceded by Spain in the same year, following the SpanishAmerican War . 141  American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the end of the Second Samoan Civil War . 142  The United States purchased the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1917. 143  Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt , John D. Rockefeller , and Andrew Carnegie led the nations progress in railroad , petroleum , and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry . The American economy boomed, becoming the worlds largest, and the United States achieved great power status. 144  These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist , socialist , and anarchist movements. 145  This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era , which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including womens suffrage , alcohol prohibition , regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions. 146  147  148  World War I, Great Depression, and World War II Further information World War I , Great Depression , and World War II The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when completed in 1931, during the Great Depression . The United States remained neutral from the outbreak of World War I in 1914 until 1917, when it joined the war as an associated power, alongside the formal Allies of World War I , helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers . In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson took a leading diplomatic role at the Paris Peace Conference and advocated strongly for the U.S. to join the League of Nations . However, the Senate refused to approve this and did not ratify the Treaty of Versailles that established the League of Nations. 149  In 1920, the womens rights movement won passage of a constitutional amendment granting womens suffrage . 150  The 1920s and 1930s saw the rise of radio for mass communication and the invention of early television . 151  The prosperity of the Roaring Twenties ended with the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression . After his election as president in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt responded with the New Deal , which included the establishment of the Social Security system. 152  The Great Migration of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s 153  whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration. 154  At first effectively neutral during World War II while Germany conquered much of continental Europe, the United States began supplying material to the Allies in March 1941 through the Lend-Lease program. On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor , prompting the United States to join the Allies against the Axis powers . 155  Although Japan attacked the United States first, the U.S. nonetheless pursued a  Europe first  defense policy. 156  The United States thus left its vast Asian colony, the Philippines , isolated and fighting a losing struggle against Japanese invasion and occupation , as military resources were devoted to the European theater . During the war, the United States was referred to as one of the  Four Policemen  157  of Allies power who met to plan the postwar world, along with Britain, the Soviet Union and China. 158  159  Although the nation lost around 400,000 military personnel, 160  it emerged relatively undamaged from the war with even greater economic and military influence. 161  The Trinity test of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a nuclear weapon The United States played a leading role in the Bretton Woods and Yalta conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europes postwar reorganization. As an Allied victory was won in Europe , a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter , which became active after the war. 162  The United States and Japan then fought each other in the largest naval battle in history in terms of gross tonnage sunk, the Battle of Leyte Gulf . 163  164  The United States eventually developed the first nuclear weapons and used them on Japan in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  causing the Japanese to surrender on September 2, ending World War II. 165  166  Parades and celebrations followed in what is known as Victory Day , or V-J Day. 167  Cold War and civil rights era Main articles History of the United States 19451964 , History of the United States 19641980 , and History of the United States 19801991 Further information Cold War , Civil Rights Movement , War on Poverty , Space Race , and Reaganomics Martin Luther King, Jr. speaking to an anti-Vietnam War rally at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul on April 27, 1967 U.S. president Ronald Reagan left and Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev , meeting in Geneva in 1985 After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed for power during what became known as the Cold War , driven by an ideological divide between capitalism and communism 168  and, according to the school of geopolitics , a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe , with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict. The United States often opposed Third World movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored, and occasionally pursued direct action for regime change against left-wing governments. 169  American troops fought communist Chinese and North Korean forces in the Korean War of 195053. 170  The Soviet Unions 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite and its 1961 launch of the first manned spaceflight initiated a  Space Race  in which the United States became the first nation to land a man on the moon in 1969. 170  A proxy war in Southeast Asia eventually evolved into full American participation, as the Vietnam War . At home, the U.S. experienced sustained economic expansion and a rapid growth of its population and middle class . Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nations infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments. 171  172  In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country. 173  The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968 , sought to end racial discrimination. 174  175  176  Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war , black nationalism , and the sexual revolution . The launch of a  War on Poverty  expanded entitlements and welfare spending, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid , two programs that provide health coverage to the elderly and poor, respectively, and the means-tested Food Stamp Program and Aid to Families with Dependent Children . 177  The 1970s and early 1980s saw the onset of stagflation . After his election in 1980, President Ronald Reagan responded to economic stagnation with free-market oriented reforms . Following the collapse of dtente , he abandoned containment and initiated the more aggressive  rollback  strategy towards the USSR. 178  179  180  181  182  After a surge in female labor participation over the previous decade, by 1985 the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed. 183  The late 1980s brought a  thaw  in relations with the USSR, and its collapse in 1991 finally ended the Cold War. 184  185  186  187  This brought about unipolarity 188  with the U.S. unchallenged as the worlds dominant superpower. The concept of Pax Americana , which had appeared in the post-World War II period, gained wide popularity as a term for the post-Cold War new world order.

Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield , a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm , in a staging titled the Gulf War waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy. 189  Originating in U.S. defense networks , the Internet spread to international academic networks, and then to the public in the 1990s, greatly affecting the global economy, society, and culture. 190  Due to the dot-com boom , stable monetary policy under Alan Greenspan , and reduced social welfare spending , the 1990s saw the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history, ending in 2001. 191  Beginning in 1994, the U.S. entered into the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA, linking 450 million people producing 17 trillion worth of goods and services. The goal of the agreement was to eliminate trade and investment barriers among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by January 1, 2008. Trade among the three partners has soared since NAFTA went into force. 192  On September 11, 2001 , Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killing nearly 3,000 people. 193  In response, the United States launched the War on Terror , which included war in Afghanistan and the 200311 Iraq War . 194  195  In 2007, the Bush administration ordered a major troop surge in the Iraq War , 196  which successfully reduced violence and led to greater stability in the region. 197  198  Government policy designed to promote affordable housing, 199  widespread failures in corporate and regulatory governance, 200  and historically low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve 201  led to the mid-2000s housing bubble , which culminated with the 2008 financial crisis , the largest economic contraction in the nations history since the Great Depression. 202  Barack Obama , the first African-American 203  and multiracial 204  president, was elected in 2008 amid the crisis, 205  and subsequently passed stimulus measures and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in an attempt to mitigate its negative effects and ensure there would not be a repeat of the crisis. The stimulus facilitated infrastructure improvements 206  and a relative decline in unemployment. 207  Dodd-Frank improved financial stability and consumer protection, 208  although there has been debate about its effects on the economy. 209  In 2010, the Obama administration passed the Affordable Care Act , which made the most sweeping reforms to the nations healthcare system in nearly five decades, including mandates , subsidies and insurance exchanges . The law caused a significant reduction in the number and percentage of people without health insurance, with 24 million covered during 2016, 210  but remains controversial due to its impact on healthcare costs, insurance premiums, and economic performance. 211  Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obamas policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014 . 212  American forces in Iraq were withdrawn in large numbers in 2009 and 2010, and the war in the region was declared formally over in December 2011. 213  The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency , 214  leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant , the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. 215  In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations with Cuba for the first time since 1961. 216  In June 2019, the Trump administration announced new restrictions on American travel to Cuba. 217  In 2015, the United States as a member of the P51 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , an agreement aimed to slow the development of Irans nuclear program , 218  though the U.S. withdrew from the deal in May 2018. 219  In the United States presidential election of 2016 , Republican Donald Trump was elected as the 45th president of the United States. Trump is both the oldest and wealthiest person elected president in United States history. 220  Geography, climate, and environment Main articles Geography of the United States , Climate of the United States , and Environment of the United States A composite satellite image of the contiguous United States and surrounding areas Kppen climate classifications The land area of the entire United States is approximately 3,800,000 square miles 9,841,955  km 2 , 221  with the contiguous United States making up 2,959,064 square miles 7,663,940.6  km 2  of that. Alaska , separated from the contiguous United States by Canada, is the largest state at 663,268 square miles 1,717,856.2  km 2 . Hawaii , occupying an archipelago in the central Pacific , southwest of North America, is 10,931 square miles 28,311  km 2  in area. The populated territories of Puerto Rico , American Samoa , Guam , Northern Mariana Islands , and U.S. Virgin Islands together cover 9,185 square miles 23,789  km 2 . 222  Measured by only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada. 223  The United States is the worlds third- or fourth- largest nation by total area land and water, ranking behind Russia and Canada and just above or below China . The ranking varies depending on how two territories disputed by China and India are counted, and how the total size of the United States is measured. d  The Encyclopdia Britannica , for instance, lists the size of the United States as 3,677,649 square miles 9,525,067  km 2 , as they do not count the countrys coastal or territorial waters. 224  The World Factbook , which includes those waters, gives 3,796,742 square miles 9,833,517  km 2 . 225  The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way further inland to deciduous forests and the rolling hills of the Piedmont . 226  The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest . 227  The Mississippi  Missouri River , the worlds fourth longest river system , runs mainly northsouth through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast. 227  Highest peak in the country, Denali The Rocky Mountains , at the western edge of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet 4,300  m in Colorado . 228  Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and deserts such as the Chihuahua and Mojave . 229  The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast , both ranges reaching altitudes higher than 14,000 feet 4,300  m. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California , 230  and only about 84 miles 135  km apart. 231  At an elevation of 20,310 feet 6,190.5  m, Alaskas Denali Mount McKinley is the highest peak in the country and North America. 232  Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaskas Alexander and Aleutian Islands , and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continents largest volcanic feature. 233  The United States has the most ecoregions out of any country in the world. 234  The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. To the east of the 100th meridian , the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. 235  The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid . Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate . The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California , and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar . Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical , as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific. 236  Extreme weather is not uncommonthe states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes , and most of the worlds tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South. 237  Wildlife Main articles Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States See also CategoryBiota of the United States The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782. 238  The U.S. ecology is megadiverse  about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1,800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland. 239  The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 bird species, 311 reptile species, and 295 amphibian species. 240  About 91,000 insect species have been described. 241  The bald eagle is both the national bird and national animal of the United States, and is an enduring symbol of the country itself. 242  There are 59 national parks and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas. 243  Altogether, the government owns about 28 of the countrys land area. 244  Most of this is protected , though some is leased for oil and gas drilling, mining, logging, or cattle ranching about .86 is used for military purposes. 245  246  Environmental issues have been on the national agenda since 1970. Environmental controversies include debates on oil and nuclear energy , dealing with air and water pollution, the economic costs of protecting wildlife, logging and deforestation , 247  248  and international responses to global warming. 249  250  Many federal and state agencies are involved. The most prominent is the Environmental Protection Agency EPA, created by presidential order in 1970. 251  The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act . 252  The Endangered Species Act of 1973 is intended to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats, which are monitored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service . 253  Demographics Main articles Americans , Demography of the United States , and Race and ethnicity in the United States Population See also List of U.S. states by population and List of United States cities by population Historical population Census Pop.  1790 3,929,214  1800 5,308,483 35.1 1810 7,239,881 36.4 1820 9,638,453 33.1 1830 12,866,020 33.5 1840 17,069,453 32.7 1850 23,191,876 35.9 1860 31,443,321 35.6 1870 38,558,371 22.6 1880 50,189,209 30.2 1890 62,979,766 25.5 1900 76,212,168 21.0 1910 92,228,496 21.0 1920 106,021,537 15.0 1930 123,202,624 16.2 1940 132,164,569 7.3 1950 151,325,798 14.5 1960 179,323,175 18.5 1970 203,211,926 13.3 1980 226,545,805 11.5 1990 248,709,873 9.8 2000 281,421,906 13.2 2010 308,745,538 9.7 Est. 2018 9  327,167,434 6.0 16101780 population data. 254  Note that the census numbers do not include Native Americans until 1860. 255  The U.S. Census Bureau estimated the countrys population to be 327,167,434 as of July 1, 2018, and to be adding 1 person net gain every 13 seconds, or about 6,646 people per day. 33  The U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century, from 76.2 million in 1900 to 281.4 million in 2000. 256  The third most populous nation in the world, after China and India , the United States is the only major industrialized nation in which large population increases are projected. 257  In the 1800s the average woman had 7.04 children 258  by the 1900s this number had decreased to 3.56. 259  Since the early 1970s the birth rate has been below the replacement rate of 2.1 with 1.76 children per woman in 2017. 260  Foreign-born immigration has caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20 million in 1990 to over 45 million in 2015, 261  representing one-third of the population increase. 262  In 2018, there were almost 90 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants  second-generation Americans in the United States, accounting for 28 of the overall U.S. population. 263  The United States has a very diverse population 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members. 264  German Americans are the largest ethnic group more than 50 million  followed by Irish Americans circa 37 million, Mexican Americans circa 31 million and English Americans circa 28 million. 265  266  White Americans mostly European ancestry group with 73.1 of total population are the largest racial group  black Americans are the nations largest racial minority note that in the U.S. Census, Hispanic and Latino Americans are counted as an ethnic group, not a racial group, and third-largest ancestry group. 264  Asian Americans are the countrys second-largest racial minority the three largest Asian American ethnic groups are Chinese Americans , Filipino Americans , and Indian Americans . 264  According to a 2015 survey, the largest American community with European ancestry is German Americans , which consists of more than 14 of the total population . 267  In 2010, the U.S. population included an estimated 5.2 million people with some American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry 2.9 million exclusively of such ancestry and 1.2 million with some native Hawaiian or Pacific island ancestry 0.5 million exclusively. 268  The census counted more than 19 million people of Some Other Race who were unable to identify with any of its five official race categories in 2010, over 18.5 million 97 of whom are of Hispanic ethnicity. 268  Most common ancestry in each U.S. state in 2000           German           American           Mexican           Irish           African           Italian           English           Japanese           Puerto Rican The population growth of Hispanic and Latino Americans the terms are officially interchangeable is a major demographic trend . The 50.5 million Americans of Hispanic descent 268  are identified as sharing a distinct  ethnicity  by the Census Bureau 64 of Hispanic Americans are of Mexican descent . 269  Between 2000 and 2010, the countrys Hispanic population increased 43 while the non-Hispanic population rose just 4.9. 270  Much of this growth is from immigration in 2007, 12.6 of the U.S. population was foreign-born , with 54 of that figure born in Latin America . 271  k  The drop in the U.S. fertility rate from 2.08 per woman in 2007 to 1.76 in 2017 was mostly due to the declining birth rate of Hispanics, teenagers, and young women, although the birth rate for older women rose, 278  below the replacement rate of 2.1. In 2018 the median age of the United States population was 38.1 years. 279  Minorities as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites  constituted 37.2 of the population in 2012 280  and over 50 of children under age one, 281  275  and are projected to constitute the majority by 2044. 281  The United States has a birth rate of 13 per 1,000, which is 5 births below the world average. 282  Its population growth rate is positive at 0.7, higher than that of many developed nations . 283  In fiscal year 2017, over one million immigrants most of whom entered through family reunification  were granted legal residence . 284  Mexico has been the leading source of new residents since the 1965 Immigration Act . China, India, and the Philippines have been in the top four sending countries since the 1990s. 285  As of 2012 update  , approximately 11.4 million residents are illegal immigrants . 286  As of 2015 update  , 47 of all immigrants are Hispanic, 26 are Asian, 18 are white and 8 are black. The percentage of immigrants who are Asian is increasing while the percentage who are Hispanic is decreasing. 261  The estimated number of illegal immigrants dropped to 10.7 million in 2017, down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007. In 2017, 33,000 refugees were resettled in the United States. This was fewer than were resettled in the rest of the world for the first time in decades. 287  A 2017 Gallup poll concluded that 4.5 of adult Americans identified as LGBT with 5.1 of women identifying as LGBT, compared with 3.9 of men. 288  The highest percentage came from the District of Columbia 10, while the lowest state was North Dakota at 1.7. 289  Major population areas The U.S. Census Bureau numerically ranks population areas by city , metropolitan statistical areas MSAs, and larger combined statistical areas CSAs. About 82 of Americans live in urban areas including suburbs 225  about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000. 290  In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four global cities had over two million  New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , and Houston . 291  There are 52 metropolitan areas with populations greater than one million. 292  Of the 50 fastest-growing metro areas, 47 are in the West or South. 293  The metro areas of San Bernardino , Dallas , Houston, Atlanta , and Phoenix all grew by more than a million people between 2000 and 2008. 292  In addition to official census groupings based on the aforementioned city, MSA and CSA level, clusters of American cities can also be known as megaregions the largest being the Great Lakes Megalopolis followed by the Northeast Megalopolis and Southern California . Language Main article Languages of the United States See also Language Spoken at Home in the United States of America , List of endangered languages in the United States , and Language education in the United States English  American English  is the de facto national language . Although there is no official language at the federal level, some lawssuch as U.S. naturalization requirements standardize English. In 2010, about 230 million, or 80 of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home. Spanish , spoken by 12 of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught second language. 294  295  Some Americans advocate making English the countrys official language, as it is in 32 states. 296  Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii , by state law. 297  Alaska recognizes twenty Native languages as well as English. 298  While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French . 299  Other states, such as California, mandate the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms. 300  Several insular territories grant official recognition to their native languages, along with English Samoan 301  is officially recognized by American Samoa .

The center is the largest medical complex in the world. The United States had a life expectancy of 78.6 years at birth in 2017, which was the third year of declines in life expectancy following decades of continuous increase. The recent decline is largely due to sharp increases in the drug overdose and suicide rates. Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among blacks. 340  341  According to CDC and Census Bureau data, deaths from suicide, alcohol and drug overdoses hit record highs in 2017. 342  Increasing obesity in the United States and health improvements elsewhere contributed to lowering the countrys rank in life expectancy from 11th in the world in 1987, to 42nd in 2007. 343  Obesity rates have more than doubled in the last 30 years, are the highest in the industrialized world, and are among the highest anywhere. 344  345  Approximately one-third of the adult population is obese and an additional third is overweight. 346  Obesity-related type 2 diabetes is considered epidemic by health care professionals. 347  In 2010, coronary artery disease , lung cancer , stroke , chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases , and traffic accidents caused the most years of life lost in the U.S. Low back pain , depression , musculoskeletal disorders , neck pain , and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking , obesity, high blood pressure , high blood sugar , physical inactivity , and alcohol use.

America solely developed or contributed significantly to 9 of the top 10 most important medical innovations since 1975 as ranked by a 2001 poll of physicians, while the European Union and Switzerland together contributed to five. 350  Since 1966, more Americans have received the Nobel Prize in Medicine than the rest of the world combined. From 1989 to 2002, four times more money was invested in private biotechnology companies in America than in Europe. 351  The U.S. health-care system far outspends any other nation, measured in both per capita spending and percentage of GDP. 352  Health-care coverage in the United States is a combination of public and private efforts and is not universal . In 2017, 12.2 of the population did not carry health insurance . 353  The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. 354  355  In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. 356  Federal legislation , passed in early 2010, roughly halved the uninsured share of the population, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy. 357  358  Education Main article Education in the United States The University of Virginia , founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of the many public universities in the United States.

Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes 1,132B or 47, Social SecuritySocial Insurance taxes 845B or 35, and corporate taxes 242B or 10. 435  Based on CBO estimates, 436  under 2013 tax law the top 1 will be paying the highest average tax rates since 1979, while other income groups will remain at historic lows. 437  U.S. taxation has historically been generally progressive , especially the federal income taxes, though by most measures it became noticeably less progressive after 1980. 438  439  It has sometimes been described as among the most progressive in the developed world, but this characterization is controversial. 440  441  442  443  439  The highest 10 of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, 444  and about half of all taxes. 445  Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax , with no tax charged on income above 118,500 for 2015 and 2016 and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. 446  447  The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. 448  449  However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70 for the top earnings quintile to about 170 for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive. 450  The top 10 paid 51.8 of total federal taxes in 2009, and the top 1, with 13.4 of pre-tax national income, paid 22.3 of federal taxes. 451  In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5 for the top 1, 27.2 for the top quintile, 13.8 for the middle quintile, and 2.7 for the bottom quintile. 452  453  The incidence of corporate income tax has been a matter of considerable ongoing controversy for decades. 443  454  State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation. 443  455  During FY 2012, the federal government spent 3.54 trillion on a budget or cash basis, down 60 billion or 1.7 vs. FY 2011 spending of 3.60 trillion. Major categories of FY 2012 spending included Medicare  Medicaid 802B or 23 of spending, Social Security 768B or 22, Defense Department 670B or 19, non-defense discretionary 615B or 17, other mandatory 461B or 13 and interest 223B or 6. 435  The total national debt of the United States in the United States was 18.527 trillion 106 of the GDP in 2014. 456  m  The United States has the largest external debt in the world . 461  Military Main article United States Armed Forces The carrier strike groups of the Kitty Hawk , Ronald Reagan , and Abraham Lincoln with aircraft from the Marine Corps , Navy , and Air Force . The president is the commander-in-chief of the countrys armed forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . The United States Department of Defense administers the armed forces, including the Army , Marine Corps , Navy , and Air Force . The Coast Guard is run by the Department of Homeland Security in peacetime and by the Department of the Navy during times of war. In 2008, the armed forces had 1.4 million personnel on active duty. The Reserves and National Guard brought the total number of troops to 2.3 million. The Department of Defense also employed about 700,000 civilians, not including contractors. 462  Military service is voluntary, though conscription may occur in wartime through the Selective Service System . 463  American forces can be rapidly deployed by the Air Forces large fleet of transport aircraft, the Navys 11 active aircraft carriers , and Marine expeditionary units at sea with the Navys Atlantic and Pacific fleets . The military operates 865 bases and facilities abroad, 464  and maintains deployments greater than 100 active duty personnel in 25 foreign countries. 465  The military budget of the United States in 2011 was more than 700 billion, 41 of global military spending and equal to the next 14 largest national military expenditures combined. At 4.7 of GDP, the rate was the second-highest among the top 15 military spenders, after Saudi Arabia . 466  U.S. defense spending as a percentage of GDP ranked 23rd globally in 2012 according to the CIA. 467  Defense spending plays a major role in science and technology investment, with roughly half of U.S. federal research and development funded by the Department of Defense. 468  Defenses share of the overall U.S. economy has generally declined in recent decades, from Cold War peaks of 14.2 of GDP in 1953 and 69.5 of federal outlays in 1954 to 4.7 of GDP and 18.8 of federal outlays in 2011. 469  US global military presence.

The New York Police Department NYPD is the largest in the country. Law enforcement in the United States is primarily the responsibility of local police departments and sheriff s offices, with state police providing broader services. The New York Police Department NYPD is the largest in the country. Federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service have specialized duties, including protecting civil rights , national security and enforcing U.S. federal courts  rulings and federal laws. 477  At the federal level and in almost every state, a legal system operates on a common law . State courts conduct most criminal trials federal courts handle certain designated crimes as well as certain appeals from the state criminal courts. Plea bargaining is very common the vast majority of criminal cases in the country are settled by plea bargain rather than jury trial . 478  In 2015, there were 15,696 murders which was 1,532 more than in 2014, a 10.8 increase, the largest since 1971. 479  The murder rate in 2015 was 4.9 per 100,000 people. 480  In 2016 the murder rate increased by 8.6, with 17,413 murders that year. 481  The national clearance rate for homicides in 2015 was 64.1, compared to 90 in 1965. 482  In 2012 there were 4.7 murders per 100,000 persons in the United States, a 54 decline from the modern peak of 10.2 in 1980. 483  In 20012, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence compared to other developed nations. 484  A cross-sectional analysis of the World Health Organization Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher. 485  Gun ownership rights continue to be the subject of contentious political debate . In 2016, the US murder rate of 5.4 per 100,000 was similar to the estimated global average of 5.15 per 100,000. 486  In 2017, there were 17,264 murders and the murder rate was 5.3 per 100,000. Regarding weapons, 73 of murders were committed by firearm, 10 by knife and 17 by other means. 487  The violent crime rose sharply in the 1960s until the early 1990s and declined in the late 1990s and 2000s. 487  In 2014, the murder rate fell to the lowest level 4.5 since 1957 4.0. 488  The violent crime rate increased by 5.9 between 2014 and 2017 and the murder rate by 20.5. Of those arrested for serious violent crimes in 2017, 58.5 were white, 37.5 were black, 2.1 were American Indian or Alaska Native and 1.5 Asian. Ethnically, 23.5 were Hispanic and 76.5 were non-Hispanic. 489  Gun violence peaked in 1993 with 17,125 gun murders before declining to 9,527 in 1999 and steadily rising since to 12,772. Non-gun murders reached a peak in 1980 of 8,340 and declined in most years until the early 2010s with 4,668 in 2017. 490  The rate of robberies declined 62 between 1990 and 2017. 487  From 1980 through 2008 males represented 77 of homicide victims and 90 of offenders. Blacks committed 52.5 of all homicides during that span, at a rate almost eight times that of whites whites includes most Hispanics, and were victimized at a rate six times that of whites. Most homicides were intraracial, with 93 of black victims killed by blacks and 84 of white victims killed by whites. 491  In 2012, Louisiana had the highest rate of murder and non-negligent manslaughter in the U.S., and New Hampshire the lowest. 492  The FBIs Uniform Crime Reports estimates that there were 3,246 violent and property crimes per 100,000 residents in 2012, for a total of over 9 million total crimes. 493  Capital punishment is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, and also at the state level in 30 states. 494  495  No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing in part to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976 the Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma . 496  Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death-penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran , Pakistan and Saudi Arabia . 497  Total incarceration in the United States by year The United States has the highest documented incarceration rate and largest prison population in the world. 498  At the start of 2008, more than 2.3 million people were incarcerated, more than one in every 100 adults. 499  In December 2012, the combined U.S. adult correctional systems supervised about 6,937,600 offenders. About 1 in every 35 adult residents in the United States was under some form of correctional supervision in December 2012, the lowest rate observed since 1997. 500  The prison population has quadrupled since 1980, 501  and state and local spending on prisons and jails has grown three times as much as that spent on public education during the same period. 502  However, the imprisonment rate for all prisoners sentenced to more than a year in state or federal facilities is 478 per 100,000 in 2013 503  and the rate for pre-trialremand prisoners is 153 per 100,000 residents in 2012. 504  The countrys high rate of incarceration is largely due to changes in sentencing guidelines and drug policies . 505  According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons , the majority of inmates held in federal prisons are convicted of drug offenses. 506  The privatization of prisons and prison services which began in the 1980s has been a subject of debate. 507  508  In 2018, Oklahoma had the highest incarceration rate 1,079 per 100,000 people, and Massachusetts the lowest 324 per 100,000 people. 509  510  Among the U.S. territories , the highest incarceration rate was in the U.S. Virgin Islands 542 per 100,000 people and the lowest was in Puerto Rico 313 per 100,000 people. 511  512  Economy Main article Economy of the United States See also Economic history of the United States Economic indicators Nominal GDP 20.66 trillion Q3 2018 513  Real GDP growth 3.5 Q3 2018 513  2.1 2017 513  CPI inflation 2.2 November 2018 514  Employment-to-population ratio 60.6 November 2018 515  Unemployment 3.7 November 2018 516  Labor force participation rate 62.9 November 2018 517  Total public debt 21.85 trillion November 2018 518  Household net worth 109.0 trillion Q3 2018 519  The United States has a capitalist mixed economy which is fueled by abundant natural resources and high productivity . 520  According to the International Monetary Fund , the U.S. GDP of 16.8 trillion constitutes 24 of the gross world product at market exchange rates and over 19 of the gross world product at purchasing power parity PPP. 521  The nominal GDP of the U.S. is estimated to be 17.528 trillion as of 2014 update  . 522  From 1983 to 2008, U.S. real compounded annual GDP growth was 3.3, compared to a 2.3 weighted average for the rest of the G7 . 523  The country ranks ninth in the world in nominal GDP per capita according to the United Nations first in the Americas 524  and sixth in GDP per capita at PPP . 521  The U.S. dollar is the worlds primary reserve currency . 525  The United States is the largest importer of goods and second-largest exporter , though exports per capita are relatively low. In 2010, the total U.S. trade deficit was 635 billion. 526  Canada , China , Mexico , Japan , and Germany are its top trading partners. 527  In 2010, oil was the largest import commodity, while transportation equipment was the countrys largest export. 526  Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. public debt. 528  The largest holder of the U.S. debt are American entities, including federal government accounts and the Federal Reserve , who hold the majority of the debt. 529  530  531  532  n  The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street , by a significant margin the worlds largest stock exchange per market capitalization of its listed companies, 535  536  at US23.1  trillion as of April 2018. 537  In 2009, the private sector was estimated to constitute 86.4 of the economy, with federal government activity accounting for 4.3 and state and local government activity including federal transfers the remaining 9.3. 538  The number of employees at all levels of government outnumber those in manufacturing by 1.7 to 1. 539  While its economy has reached a postindustrial level of development and its service sector constitutes 67.8 of GDP, the United States remains an industrial power. 540  The leading business field by gross business receipts is wholesale and retail trade by net income it is manufacturing. 541  In the franchising business model, McDonalds and Subway are the two most recognized brands in the world. Coca-Cola is the most recognized soft drink company in the world. 542  Chemical products are the leading manufacturing field. 543  The United States is the largest producer of oil in the world, as well as its second-largest importer. 544  It is the worlds number one producer of nuclear energy, as well as liquid natural gas , sulfur , phosphates , and salt . The National Mining Association provides data pertaining to coal and minerals that include beryllium , copper , lead , magnesium , zinc , titanium and others. 545  546  Agriculture accounts for just under 1 of GDP, 540  yet the United States is the worlds top producer of corn 547  and soybeans . 548  The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts , oats , rye , wheat , rice , cotton , corn , barley , hay , sunflowers , and oilseeds . In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture USDA provides livestock statistics regarding beef , poultry , pork , and dairy products . The country is the primary developer and grower of genetically modified food , representing half of the worlds biotech crops. 549  In the contiguous 48 states, 35 of the land is used as pasture , 28 is covered by forest , and 21 is agricultural cropland , with all other uses accounting for less than 20. 550  A tract housing development in San Jose, California Consumer spending comprises 68 of the U.S. economy in 2015. 551  In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people. With 21.2 million people, government is the leading field of employment. The largest private employment sector is health care and social assistance, with 16.4 million people. About 12 of workers are unionized , compared to 30 in Western Europe . 552  The United States has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000. 553  The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. 554  The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to. 555  The United States is the only advanced economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation 556  and is one of just a few countries in the world without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea , Suriname and Liberia . 557  While federal law does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 558  74 of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , although only 24 of part-time workers get the same benefits. 558  In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway . It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands . 559  The 20082012 global recession significantly affected the United States, with output still below potential according to the Congressional Budget Office . 560  It brought high unemployment which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels, along with low consumer confidence , the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies , an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation , and rising petroleum and food prices . Science and technology Main articles Science and technology in the United States and Science policy of the United States Astronaut James Irwin walking on the Moon next to Apollo 15 s landing module and lunar rover in 1971 The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing interchangeable parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large-scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles, and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing . Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor-saving techniques created the system called mass production . 561  In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone . Thomas Edison s research laboratory , one of the first of its kind, developed the phonograph , the first long-lasting light bulb , and the first viable movie camera . 562  The latter led to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry . In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The Wright brothers , in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight . 563  The rise of fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s led many European scientists, including Albert Einstein , Enrico Fermi , and John von Neumann , to immigrate to the United States. 564  During World War II, the Manhattan Project developed nuclear weapons, ushering in the Atomic Age , while the Space Race produced rapid advances in rocketry, materials science , and aeronautics . 565  566  The invention of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics , led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry. 567  568  569  This, in turn, led to the establishment of many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices AMD, and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems , Apple Inc. , IBM , Microsoft , and Sun Microsystems created and popularized the personal computer . The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became the first of a series of networks which evolved into the Internet . 570  These advancements then lead to greater personalization of technology for individual use. 571  As of 2013 update  , 83.8 of American households owned at least one computer , and 73.3 had high-speed Internet service. 572  91 of Americans also own a mobile phone as of May  2013 update  . 573  The United States ranks highly with regard to freedom of use of the internet. 574  In the 21st century, approximately two-thirds of research and development funding comes from the private sector. 575  The United States leads the world in scientific research papers and impact factor . 576  577  Income, poverty and wealth Further information Income in the United States , Poverty in the United States , Affluence in the United States , United States counties by per capita income , and Income inequality in the United States Accounting for 4.4 of the global population, Americans collectively possess 41.6 of the worlds total wealth, 578  and Americans make up roughly half of the worlds population of millionaires. 579  The Global Food Security Index ranked the U.S. number one for food affordability and overall food security in March 2013. 580  Americans on average have over twice as much living space per dwelling and per person as European Union residents, and more than every EU nation. 581  For 2017 the United Nations Development Programme ranked the United States 13th among 189 countries in its Human Development Index and 25th among 151 countries in its inequality-adjusted HDI IHDI. 582  Wealth inequality in the United States increased from 1989 to 2013. 583  After years of stagnant growth, in 2016, according to the Census, median household income reached a record high after two consecutive years of record growth, although income inequality remains at record highs with top fifth of earners taking home more than half of all overall income. 584  There has been a widening gap between productivity and median incomes since the 1970s. 585  However, the gap between total compensation and productivity is not as wide because of increased employee benefits such as health insurance. 586  The rise in the share of total annual income received by the top 1 percent, which has more than doubled from 9 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2011, has significantly affected income inequality , 587  leaving the United States with one of the widest income distributions among OECD nations. 588  According to a 2018 study by the OECD, the United States has much higher income inequality and a larger percentage of low-income workers than almost any other developed nation. This is largely because at-risk workers get almost no government support and are further set back by a very weak collective bargaining system. 589  The top 1 percent of income-earners accounted for 52 percent of the income gains from 2009 to 2015, where income is defined as market income excluding government transfers. 590  The extent and relevance of income inequality is a matter of debate. 591  592  593  United States families median net worth Source Fed Survey of Consumer Finances 594  in 2013 dollars 1998 2013 change All families 102,500 81,200 -20.8 Bottom 20 of incomes 8,300 6,100 -26.5 2nd lowest 20 of incomes 47,400 22,400 -52.7 Middle 20 of incomes 76,300 61,700 -19.1 Top 10 646,600 1,130,700 74.9 Wealth , like income and taxes, is highly concentrated  the richest 10 of the adult population possess 72 of the countrys household wealth, while the bottom half claim only 2. 595  According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1 controlled 38.6 of the countrys wealth in 2016. 596  Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value. 597  Since peaking in the second quarter of 2007, household wealth was down 14  trillion, but has since increased 14  trillion over 2006 levels. 598  599  At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to 11.8  trillion, 600  down from 13.8  trillion at the end of 2008. 601  There were about 578,424 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in the U.S. in January 2014, with almost two-thirds staying in an emergency shelter or transitional housing program. 602  In 2011 16.7 million children lived in food-insecure households , about 35 more than 2007 levels, though only 1.1 of U.S. children, or 845,000, saw reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns at some point during the year, and most cases were not chronic. 603  According to a 2014 report by the Census Bureau, one in five young adults lives in poverty , up from one in seven in 1980. 604  As of September  2017 update  , 40 million people, roughly 12.7 of the U.S. population, were living in poverty, with 18.5 million of those living in deep poverty a family income below one-half of the poverty threshold. In 2016, 13.3 million children were living in poverty, which made up 32.6 of the impoverished population. 605  In 2017, the region with the lowest poverty rate was New Hampshire 7.3, and the region with the highest poverty rate was American Samoa 65. 606  607  608  Among the states, the highest poverty rate was in Mississippi 21.9. 609  According to the UN, around five million people in the U.S. live in third world conditions. 610  Infrastructure Transportation Main article Transportation in the United States The Interstate Highway System , which extends 46,876 miles 75,440  km. 611  Personal transportation is dominated by automobiles, which operate on a network of 4  million miles 6.4  million kilometers of public roads, 612  including one of the worlds longest highway systems at 57,000  mi 91,700  km. 613  The worlds second-largest automobile market, 614  the United States has the highest rate of per-capita vehicle ownership in the world, with 765 vehicles per 1,000 Americans 1996. 615  About 40 of personal vehicles are vans, SUVs , or light trucks. 616  The average American adult accounting for all drivers and non-drivers spends 55 minutes driving every day, traveling 29 miles 47  km. 617  In 2017, there were 255,009,283 motor vehiclesincluding cars, vans, buses, freight, and other trucks, but excluding motorcycles and other two-wheelersor 910 vehicles per 1,000 people. 618  Map showing Amtrak passenger rail speeds in the United States. 619  Mass transit accounts for 9 of total U.S. work trips. 620  621  Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers approximately 31 million annually use intercity rail to travel, partly because of the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. 622  623  However, ridership on Amtrak , the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37 between 2000 and 2010. 624  Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. 625  Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal. 626  The civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978 , while most major airports are publicly owned. 627  The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways . 628  Of the worlds 50 busiest passenger airports , 16 are in the United States, including the busiest, HartsfieldJackson Atlanta International Airport , the fourth-busiest Los Angeles International Airport , and the sixth-busiest OHare International Airport in Chicago . 629  In the aftermath of the 911 attacks of 2001, the Transportation Security Administration was created to police airports and commercial airliners. Energy Further information Energy policy of the United States The United States energy market is about 29,000 terawatt hours per year. 630  Energy consumption per capita is 7.8  tons 7076  kg of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40 of this energy came from petroleum, 23 from coal, and 22 from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources. 631  The United States is the worlds largest consumer of petroleum. 632  The United States has 27 of global coal reserves. 633  It is the worlds largest producer of natural gas and crude oil. 634  For decades, nuclear power has played a limited role relative to many other developed countries, in part because of public perception following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. In 2007, several applications for new nuclear plants were filed. 635  Since 2007, the total greenhouse gas emissions by the United States are the second highest by country, exceeded only by China . 636  637  The United States has historically been the worlds largest producer of greenhouse gases and greenhouse gas emissions per capita remain high. 638  Water supply and sanitation Main article Drinking water supply and sanitation in the United States Issues that affect water supply in the United States include droughts in the West, water scarcity , pollution , a backlog of investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall as a result of climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows . 639  640  o  Culture Main article Culture of the United States The United States is home to many cultures and a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values. 643  644  Aside from the Native American , Native Hawaiian , and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated within the past five centuries. 645  Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa . 643  646  More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot , and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics. 643  Core American culture was established by Protestant British colonists and shaped by the frontier settlement process, with the traits derived passed down to descendants and transmitted to immigrants through assimilation. Americans have traditionally been characterized by a strong work ethic , competitiveness, and individualism, 647  as well as a unifying belief in an American creed  emphasizing liberty, equality, private property, democracy, rule of law, and a preference for limited government. 648  Americans are extremely charitable by global standards. According to a 2006 British study, Americans gave 1.67 of GDP to charity, more than any other nation studied, more than twice the second place British figure of 0.73, and around twelve times the French figure of 0.14. 649  650  651  The American Dream , or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility , plays a key role in attracting immigrants. 652  Whether this perception is realistic has been a topic of debate. 653  654  655  656  523  657  While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society , 658  scholars identify significant differences between the countrys social classes, affecting socialization , language, and values. 659  Americans self-images, social viewpoints, and cultural expectations are associated with their occupations to an unusually close degree. 660  While Americans tend greatly to value socioeconomic achievement, being ordinary or average is generally seen as a positive attribute. 661  Food Main article Cuisine of the United States Apple pie is a food commonly associated with American cuisine. Mainstream American cuisine is similar to that in other Western countries. Wheat is the primary cereal grain with about three-quarters of grain products made of wheat flour 662  and many dishes use indigenous ingredients, such as turkey, venison, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup which were consumed by Native Americans and early European settlers. 663  These homegrown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of Americas most popular holidays, Thanksgiving , when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion. 664  Roasted turkey is a traditional menu item of an American Thanksgiving dinner. 665  Characteristic dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrants. French fries, Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are widely consumed. 666  Americans drink three times as much coffee as tea. 667  Marketing by U.S. industries is largely responsible for making orange juice and milk ubiquitous breakfast beverages. 668  669  American eating habits owe a great deal to that of their British culinary roots with some variations. Although American lands could grow newer vegetables that Britain could not, most colonists would not eat these new foods until accepted by Europeans. 670  Over time American foods changed to a point that food critic, John L. Hess stated in 1972 Our founding fathers were as far superior to our present political leaders in the quality of their food as they were in the quality of their prose and intelligence . 671  The American fast food industry, the worlds largest, 672  pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s. 673  Fast food consumption has sparked health concerns. During the 1980s and 1990s, Americans caloric intake rose 24 666  frequent dining at fast food outlets is associated with what public health officials call the American  obesity epidemic . 674  Highly sweetened soft drinks are widely popular, and sugared beverages account for nine percent of American caloric intake. 675  Literature, philosophy, and visual art Main articles American literature , American philosophy , Architecture of the United States , and Visual art of the United States Mark Twain , American author and humorist . In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne , Edgar Allan Poe , and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the centurys second half Emily Dickinson , virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet. 676  A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and charactersuch as Herman Melville s Moby-Dick 1851, Twains The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn 1885, F. Scott Fitzgerald s The Great Gatsby 1925 and Harper Lee s To Kill a Mockingbird 1960may be dubbed the  Great American Novel . 677  Twelve U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature , most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. William Faulkner , Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century. 678  Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth , Thomas Pynchon , and Don DeLillo . 679  The transcendentalists , led by Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson , established the first major American philosophical movement . After the Civil War, Charles Sanders Peirce and then William James and John Dewey were leaders in the development of pragmatism . In the 20th century, the work of W. V. O. Quine and Richard Rorty , and later Noam Chomsky , brought analytic philosophy to the fore of American philosophical academia. John Rawls and Robert Nozick led a revival of political philosophy , and Martha Nussbaum is its most important figure today. Cornel West and Judith Butler have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia. Chicago school economists like Milton Friedman , James M. Buchanan , and Thomas Sowell have affected various fields in social and political philosophy. 680  681  In the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism . The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art , shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. 682  Georgia OKeeffe , Marsden Hartley , and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright , Philip Johnson , and Frank Gehry . 683  Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography , with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz , Edward Steichen , and Ansel Adams . 684  Times Square in New York City , the hub of the Broadway theater district 685  One of the first major promoters of American theater was impresario P. T. Barnum , who began operating a lower Manhattan entertainment complex in 1841. The team of Harrigan and Hart produced a series of popular musical comedies in New York starting in the late 1870s. In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on Broadway  the songs of musical theater composers such as Irving Berlin , Cole Porter , and Stephen Sondheim have become pop standards . Playwright Eugene ONeill won the Nobel literature prize in 1936 other acclaimed U.S. dramatists include multiple Pulitzer Prize winners Tennessee Williams , Edward Albee , and August Wilson . 686  Music Main articles Music of the United States and American classical music Although little known at the time, Charles Ives s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as Henry Cowell and John Cage created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have deeply influenced American music at large, distinguishing it from European and African traditions. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is now known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century. Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. 687  Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the mid-1950s pioneers of rock and roll . Rock bands such as Metallica , the Eagles , and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing in worldwide sales. 688  689  690  In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of Americas most celebrated songwriters and James Brown led the development of funk . More recent American creations include hip hop and house music . American pop stars such as Elvis Presley , Michael Jackson , and Madonna have become global celebrities, 687  as have contemporary musical artists such as Taylor Swift , Britney Spears , Katy Perry , Beyonc , Jay-Z , Eminem , Kanye West , and Ariana Grande . 691  Cinema Main article Cinema of the United States The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles , California Hollywood , a northern district of Los Angeles , California, is one of the leaders in motion picture production. 692  The worlds first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison s Kinetoscope . 693  The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film s development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization. 694  Director D. W. Griffith , the top American filmmaker during the silent film period, was central to the development of film grammar , and producerentrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising . 695  Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West and history, and, like others such as John Huston , broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting, with great influence on subsequent directors. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the  Golden Age of Hollywood , from the early sound period until the early 1960s, 696  with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures. 697  698  In the 1970s, film directors such as Martin Scorsese , Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Altman were a vital component in what became known as  New Hollywood  or the Hollywood Renaissance, 699  grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period . 700  Since, directors such as Steven Spielberg , George Lucas and James Cameron have gained renown for their blockbuster films, often characterized by high production costs, and in return, high earnings at the box office, with the Russo brothers , Avengers Endgame 2019 being the highest grossing film of all time. 701  Notable films topping the American Film Institute s AFI 100 list include Orson Welles s Citizen Kane 1941, which is frequently cited as the greatest film of all time, 702  703  Casablanca 1942, The Godfather 1972, Gone with the Wind 1939, Lawrence of Arabia 1962, The Wizard of Oz 1939, The Graduate 1967, On the Waterfront 1954, Schindlers List 1993, Singin in the Rain 1952, Its a Wonderful Life 1946 and Sunset Boulevard 1950. 704  The Academy Awards , popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929, 705  and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944. 706  Sports Main article Sports in the United States The most popular American sports are American football , baseball , basketball and ice hockey 707  American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport 708  the National Football League NFL has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally.

With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy , which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers by small chains that own a handful of papers or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families.

U.S. sovereignty over Bajo Nuevo Bank , Navassa Island , Serranilla Bank , and Wake Island is disputed. 15   Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its long-held claim over the Pacific Northwest, which dated back to the 16th century. During the decade 17851795 British merchants, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks and supported by their government, made a sustained attempt to develop this trade despite Spains claims and navigation rights. The endeavors of these merchants did not last long in the face of Spains opposition. The challenge was also opposed by a Japanese holding obdurately to national seclusion. 99   Fertility is also a factor in 2010 the average Hispanic woman gave birth to 2.35 children in her lifetime, compared to 1.97 for non-Hispanic black women and 1.79 for non-Hispanic white women both below the replacement rate of 2.1. 272  Between 2006 and 2017 the population growth rate for Hispanics dropped from 3.7 to 2.0, for Asians from 3.5 to 2.9, for blacks from 1.0 to 0.9 and for non-Hispanic whites from 0.1 to 0.0. Hispanics accounted for 51 of the population increase between 2016 and 2017. 273  Minorities as defined by the Census Bureau as all those beside non-Hispanic, non-multiracial whites constituted 36.3 of the population in 2010 this is nearly 40 in 2015, 274  and over 50 of children under age one, 275  and are projected to constitute the majority by 2042. 276  This contradicts the report by the National Vital Statistics Reports, based on the U.S. census data, which concludes that 54 2,162,406 out of 3,999,386 in 2010 of births were non-Hispanic white. 272  The Hispanic birth rate plummeted 25 between 2006 and 2013 while the rate for non-Hispanics decreased just 5. 277   Source 2015 American Community Survey , U.S. Census Bureau .

For the language groups listed above, the strongest English-language proficiency is among speakers of German 96 report that they speak English well or very well, followed by speakers of French 93.5, Tagalog 92.8, Spanish 74.1, Korean 71.5, Chinese 70.4, and Vietnamese 66.9.  In January 2015, U.S. federal government debt held by the public was approximately 13 trillion, or about 72 of U.S. GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at 5 trillion, giving a combined total debt of 18.080 trillion. 457  458  By 2012, total federal debt had surpassed 100 of U.S. GDP. 459  The U.S. has a credit rating of AA from Standard  Poors , AAA from Fitch , and AAA from Moodys . 460   The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute , SIPRI, found that the United States arms industry was the worlds biggest exporter of major weapons from 2005 to 2009, 533  and remained the largest exporter of major weapons during a period between 2010 and 2014, followed by Russia, China PRC, and Germany. 534   Droughts are likely to particularly affect the 66 percent of Americans whose communities depend on surface water. 641  As for drinking water quality, there are concerns about disinfection by-products, lead , perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances, but generally drinking water quality in the U.S. is good. 642  References  McKenna 2007 , p.  280.
