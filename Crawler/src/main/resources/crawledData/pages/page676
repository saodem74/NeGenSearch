Acronym From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For the acronym  HTML tag, see HTML element   acronym . For the use of acronyms on Wikipedia, see WikipediaAcronyms . An acronym is a word or name formed as a type of abbreviation from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters, as in NATO  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  or scuba Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus, sometimes syllables, as in Benelux Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, or a mixture of the two, as in radar RAdio Detection And Ranging. There are no universal standards for the multiple names for such abbreviations or for their orthographic styling . Acronyms result from a word formation process known as blending , in which parts of two or more words are combined to form a new word. This article does not cite any sources .

Attestations for Akronym in German are known from 1921, and for acronym in English from 1940. 1  Although the word acronym is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters, 2  some dictionaries and usage commentators define acronym to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word, 18  in contrast to an initialism or alphabetism   an abbreviation formed from a string of initials and possibly pronounced as individual letters. 19  Some dictionaries include additional senses equating acronym with initialism . 20  21  22  The distinction, when made, hinges on whether the abbreviation is pronounced as a word or as a string of individual letters. Examples in reference works that make the distinction include  NATO    n e t o  ,  scuba    s k u b   , and  radar    r e d r  for acronyms and  FBI     f  b i  a  ,  CRT    s i  r  t i  , and  HTML    e t  t i   m   l  for initialisms. 3  15  23  24  The rest of this article uses acronym for both types of abbreviation. The distinction is not well-maintained. According to Merriam-Websters Dictionary of English Usage  2  A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... Initialism , an older word than acronym , seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with acronym in a narrow sense. About the use of acronym to only mean those pronounced as words, Fowlers Modern English Usage 3rd ed. states 25  The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, acronym is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called initialisms . A clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles  Algeo 1970, 2  who divided acronyms as a general category into word acronyms pronounced as words, and initialisms sounded out as letters. There is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as  JPEG    d e p    and  MS-DOS     m  s  d  s  . There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms  URL  and  IRA  can be pronounced as individual letters   ju  r   l  and   a  r  e  , respectively or as a single word  r l  and   a r   , respectively.  citation needed  The spelled-out form of an acronym or initialism that is, what it stands for is called its expansion .

Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been. Ancient examples of acronymy regardless of whether there was metalanguage at the time to describe it include the following Acronyms were used in Rome before the Christian era. For example, the official name for the Roman Empire, and the Republic before it, was abbreviated as SPQR  Senatus Populusque Romanus . Inscriptions dating from antiquity, both on stone and on coins, use many abbreviations and acronyms to save space and work. For example, Roman first names , of which there was only a small set, were almost always abbreviated. Common terms were abbreviated too, such as writing just F for filius , meaning son, a very common part of memorial inscriptions mentioning people. Grammatical markers were abbreviated or left out entirely if they could be inferred from the rest of the text. So-called nomina sacra sacred names were used in many Greek biblical manuscripts. The common words God   , Jesus   , Christ   , and some others, would be abbreviated by their first and last letters, marked with an overline. This was just one of many kinds of conventional scribal abbreviation, used to reduce the time-consuming workload of the scribe and save on valuable writing materials. The same convention is still commonly used in the inscriptions on religious icons and the stamps used to mark the eucharistic bread in Eastern Churches . The early Christians in Rome, most of whom were Greek rather than Latin speakers, used the image of a fish as a symbol for Jesus in part because of an acronymfish in Greek is ichthys   , which was said to stand for       Iesous Christos Theou huios Soter  Jesus Christ, Gods Son, Savior. This interpretation dates from the 2nd and 3rd centuries and is preserved in the catacombs of Rome. And for centuries, the Church has used the inscription INRI over the crucifix, which stands for the Latin Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews. The Hebrew language has a long history of formation of acronyms pronounced as words, stretching back many centuries. The Hebrew Bible Old Testament is known as  Tanakh , an acronym composed from the Hebrew initial letters of its three major sections  Torah  five books of Moses,  Neviim  prophets, and  Ktuvim  writings. Many rabbinical figures from the Middle Ages onward are referred to in rabbinical literature by their pronounced acronyms, such as Rambam and Rashi from the initial letters of their full Hebrew names Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon and Rabbi Shlomo Yitzkhaki. During the mid- to late 19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities abbreviating corporation names such as on the sides of railroad cars e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad  RF P on the sides of barrels and crates and on ticker tape and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it e.g. American Telephone and Telegraph Company  AT T. Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include  Nabisco  National Biscuit Company, 31   Esso  from S.O., from  Standard Oil , and  Sunoco  Sun Oil Company. Another driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare, with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the American Civil War acronyms such as  ANV  for Army of Northern Virginia post-date the war itself, they had become somewhat common in World War I and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during World War II , 32  who themselves were referred to as G.I.s . The widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of registers is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new and sometimes more complex terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The Oxford English Dictionary  OED  records the first printed use of the word initialism as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after acronym had become common. By 1943, the term acronym had been used in English to recognize abbreviations and contractions of phrases that were pronounced as words. 31  It was formed from the Greek words  , akros , topmost, extreme and  , onoma , name. For example, the army offense of being absent without official leave was abbreviated to  A.W.O.L.  in reports, but when pronounced as a word  awol , it became an acronym. 33  While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words, 34  for example UNIVAC from UNIVersal Automatic Computer. 35  In English, acronyms pronounced as words may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in Word Myths Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends claims that forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- and now twenty-first- century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century English word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is colinderies or colinda , an acronym for the Colonial and Indian Exposition held in London in that year. 36  37  However, although acronymic words seem not to have been employed in general vocabulary before the 20th century as Wilton points out, the concept of their formation is treated as effortlessly understood and evidently not novel in a Poe story of the 1830s,  How to Write a Blackwood Article , which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.. Early examples in English  edit  The use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in vernaculars has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are A.M. from Latin ante meridiem , before noon and P.M. from Latin post meridiem , after noon A.D. from Latin Anno Domini , in the year of our Lord, whose complement in English, B.C.  Before Christ , is English-sourced O.K. , a term of disputed origin, dating back at least to the early 19th century, now used around the world The earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the OED is abjud now  abjad , formed from the original first four letters of the Arabic alphabet in the late 18th century. 38  Some acrostics predate this, however, such as the Restoration witticism arranging the names of some members of Charles II s Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the CABAL ministry . 39  Current use  edit  Acronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The armed forces and government agencies frequently employ acronyms some well-known examples from the United States are among the  alphabet agencies  also jokingly referred to as  alphabet soup  created by Franklin D. Roosevelt also of course known as FDR under the New Deal . Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names.  citation needed  One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific it is also seen as ComCruDesPac. YABA-compatible where YABA stands for yet another bloody acronym is used to mean that a terms acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g. When choosing a new name, be sure it is YABA-compati ble. 40  Acronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with short message service SMS, and instant messenger IM. To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, and to save time, acronyms such as GF girlfriend, LOL laughing out loud, and DL download or down low have become popular. 41  Some prescriptivists disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use pure or proper English. Others point out that language change has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in proper English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space e.g., ticker tape, newspaper column inches . Aids to learning the expansion without leaving a document  edit  This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources .

The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a common noun such as frequently asked questions FAQ but uppercase for a proper noun such as the United Nations UN as explained at Case  Casing of expansions . In addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all the acronyms used they have used and what their expansions are. This is a convenience for readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially which is a common mode of reading, then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expans ion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available. The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering. In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions redundant for such readers. Expansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, but they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as tooltips , hyperlinks , and rapid search via search engine technology . Jargon  edit  Acronyms often occur in jargon . An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed. The medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology. 42  As mnemonics  edit  Acronyms are often taught as mnemonic devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are said to be  ROY G. BIV  red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet. They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation  GUMPS , which is gas-undercarriage-mixture-propeller-seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms are  CAN SLIM , and PAVPANIC as well as  PEMDAS . Acronyms as legendary etymology  edit  See also Backronym It is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of false etymology , called a folk etymology , for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in historical linguistics , and are examples of language-related urban legends . For example,  cop  is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from constable on patrol, 43  and  posh  from  port outward, starboard home . 44  With some of these specious expansions, the belief that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been tongue-in-cheek among many citers, as with gentlemen only, ladies forbidden for  golf , although many other more credulous  people have uncritically taken it for fact. 44  45  Taboo words in particular commonly have such false etymologies  shit  from shipstore high in transit 36  46  or special high-intensity training and  fuck  from for unlawful carnal knowledge, or fornication under consentcommand of the king. 46  Orthographic styling  edit  Punctuation  edit  Showing the ellipsis of letters  edit  In English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a full stopperiodpoint in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of lettersalthough the colon and apostrophe have also had this roleand with a space after full stops e.g. A.  D.. In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation. 47  Ellipsis-is-understood style  edit  Some influential style guides , such as that of the BBC , no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of The Penguin Guide to Punctuation , states categorically that, in British English , this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete. 48  Pronunciation-dependent style and periods  edit  Nevertheless, some influential style guides , many of them American , still require periods in certain instances. For example, The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in  K.G.B. , but not when pronounced as a word, as in  NATO . 49  The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme. Other conventions  edit  When a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. TV, for example, may stand for a single word television or transvestite, for instance, and is in general spelled without punctuation except in the plural. Although PS stands for the single word  postscript  or the Latin postscriptum , it is often spelled with periods P.S.. The slash , or solidus  is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in NA not applicable, not available, co care of and wo without. Inconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example,  i18n  abbreviates  internationalization , a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The 18 represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in internationalization. Localization can be abbreviated l10n,  multilingualization  m17n, and  accessibility  a11y. In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general x can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include Crxn for crystallization and the series familiar to physicians for history , diagnosis , and treatment hx, dx, tx. Representing plurals and possessives  edit  There is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an s following an apostrophe, as in PCs. However, Kate Turabian , writing about style in academic writings, 50  allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters. Turabian would therefore prefer DVDs and URLs and Ph.D.s. The Modern Language Association 51  and American Psychological Association 52  53  prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods so compact discs would be CDs or C.D.s, whereas The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods preferring PCs, TVs and VCRs. 54  Possessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex for example, the C.D.s labels the labels of the compact discs. In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is S, as in SOSs although abbreviations ending with S can also take -es, e.g . SOSes, or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods. 55  56  A particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is Member of Parliament, which in plural is Members of Parliament. It is possible then to abbreviate this as Ms P. 57  58  or similar 59  , as used by former Australian Prime Minister Ben Chifley . 60  61  62  This usage is less common than forms with s at the end, such as MPs, and may appear dated or pedantic. In common usage, therefore, weapons of mass destruction becomes WMDs, prisoners of war becomes POWs, and runs batted in becomes RBIs. 63  The argument that acronyms should have no different plural form for example, If D can stand for disc , it can also stand for discs  is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already For example, U.S. is short for United States, but not United State. In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural fo rm without a final s may seem awkward for example, U.S., U.S.s, etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple attributive usage for example, the U.S. economy or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and then making the possessive for example, the United States economy. On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation United Statess sometimes is used. Abbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, wordssuch as TV televisionare usually pluralized without apostrophes two TVs most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive the TVs antenna. In some languages, the convention of doubling the letters in the acronym is used to indicate plural words for example, the Spanish EE. UU. , for Estados Unidos United States. This old convention is still followed for a limited number of English abbreviations, such as SS. for Saints, pp. for the Latin plural of pages, paginae , or MSS for manuscripts. In the case of pp. it derives from the original Latin phrase  per procurationem  meaning through the agency of 64  an English translation alternative is particular pages in a book or document see pp. 888. 65  Further information English possessive Case  edit  All-caps style  edit  The most common capitalization scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase  all-caps , except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words  scuba ,  laser , and  radar these are known as anacronyms . 66  Anacronyms note well -acro-  should not be homophonously confused with anachronyms note well -chron- , which are a type of misnomer . Small-caps variant  edit  Small caps are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the Atlantic Monthly and USA Today , is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters  citation needed   thus U.S. and  FDR  in normal caps, but  .mw-parser-output .smallcapsfont-variantsmall-caps nato  in small caps. The acronyms  AD  and  BC  are often smallcapped as well, as in From 4004 bc to ad 525 . Mixed-case variant  edit  Words derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, pre-WWII politics, post-NATO world,  DNAase . In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example,  messenger RNA  and  transfer RNA  become mRNA and tRNA. Pronunciation-dependent style and case  edit  Some publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms Nato and Aids in mixed case, but the initialisms USA and FBI in all caps. For example, this is the style used in The Guardian , 67  and BBC News typically edits to this style though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps 68  . The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme. Some style manuals also base the letters case on their number. The New York Times , for example, keeps NATO in all capitals while several guides in the British press may render it Nato, but uses lower case in  UNICEF  from United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly flirting with the appearance of shouting capitals. Numerals and constituent words  edit  While abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short function words such as and, or, of, or to, this is not always the case. A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in headers and publication titles . Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE  Congress of Racial Equality . Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL  Transport for London  and LotR  Lord of the Rings  this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun. Numbers both cardinal and ordinal  in names are often represented by digits rather than initial letters as in 4GL  fourth generation language  or G77  Group of 77 . Large numbers may use metric prefixes , as with  Y2K  for Year 2000 sometimes written Y2k, because the SI symbol for 1000 is knot K, which stands for  kelvin . Exceptions using initials for numbers include  TLA  three-letter acronymabbreviation and GoF  Gang of Four . Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as  W3C  World Wide Web Consortium and T3  Trends, Tips  Tools for Everyday Living  pronunciation, such as  B2B  business to business and numeronyms , such as i18n internationalization 18 represents the 18 letters between the initial i and the final n. Casing of expansions  edit  Although many authors of expository writing show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis trying to thrust the readers attention toward where the letters are coming from, this sometimes conflicts with the convention of English orthography , which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for proper nouns . Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors  citation needed  case-fold such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that 1 readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that 2 common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography. Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or ital ic font for the initial letters.  citation needed  For example, the onset of Congestive Heart Failure CHF or the onset of c ongestive h eart f ailure CHF if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as the onset of congestive heart failure CHF in the final published article when following the AMA Manual of Style . 69  Changes to or word play on the expanded meaning  edit  Pseudo-acronyms  edit  Some apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such pseudo-acronyms may be pronunciation-based, such as BBQ  bee-bee-cue , for barbecue, or  K9   kay-nine  for canine. Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as orphan initialisms an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning. 70  71  For example, the letters of the  SAT , a US college entrance test originally dubbed Scholastic Aptitude Test, no longer officially stand for anything. 72  73  This is common with companies that want to retain brand recognition while moving away from an outdated image American Telephone and Telegraph became AT T , 70   Kentucky Fried Chicken  became  KFC  to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes, 74  a  and British Petroleum became BP. 71  75  Russia Today has rebranded itself as RT . American Movie Classics has simply rebranded itself as AMC. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotagevandalism by Luddite activists.  citation needed  The Learning Channel became TLC following its move towards reality series involving lifestyles, family life, and personal stories, and American District Telegraph became simply known as ADT. Pseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets  according to whom  for example, some national affiliates of International Business Machines are legally incorporated as IBM for example, IBM Canada to avoid translating the full name into local languages.  citation needed  Likewise,  UBS  is the name of the merged Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation , 76  and  HSBC  has replaced The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Sometimes,  when  companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign marketsfor example, Toronto-Dominion Bank continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as  TD Bank ,  citation needed  just as Royal Bank of Canada used its full name in Canada a constitutional monarchy , but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called  RBC Bank .  citation needed  Redundant acronyms and RAS syndrome  edit  Main article RAS syndrome This section has multiple issues.

A few high-tech companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd. Examples in entertainment include the television shows CSI Crime Scene Investigation and Navy NCIS Navy was dropped in the second season, where the redundancy was likely designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for. The same reasoning was in evidence when the Royal Bank of Canada s Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank, or when Bank of Montreal rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal. Another common example is  RAM memory, which is redundant because RAM random-access memory includes the initial of the word memory. PIN stands for personal identification number, obviating the second word in  PIN number  in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word pin. Other examples include  ATM machine,  EAB bank ,  CableACE Award ,  DC Comics ,  HIV virus, Microsofts NT Technology, and the formerly redundant  SAT test, now simply SAT Reasoning Test. TNN The NashvilleNational Network also renamed itself The New TNN for a brief interlude. Simple redefining  edit  Sometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples DVD was originally an acronym of the unofficial term digital video disc, but is now stated by the DVD Forum as standing for Digital Versatile Disc GAO changed the full form of its name from General Accounting Office to Government Accountability Office GPO in the United States changed the full form of its name from Government Printing Office to Government Publishing Office RAID used to mean Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, but is now commonly interpreted as Redundant Array of Independent Disks WWF originally stood for World Wildlife Fund , but now stands for Worldwide Fund for Nature although the former name is still used in Canada and the United States The UICC , whose initials came from the Romance-language versions of its name such as French Union Internationale Contre le Cancer , International Union Against Cancer, changed the English expansion of its name to Union for International Cancer Control from International Union Against Cancer so that the English expansion, too, would correspond to the UICC initials Backronyms  edit  Main article Backronym A backronym or bacronym  is a phrase that is constructed after the fact from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess once proposed that the word book ought to stand for box of organized knowledge. 77  A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The Apple Lisa , which was said to refer to Local Integrated Software Architecture, but was actually named after Steve Jobss daughter, born in 1978. Backronyms are oftentimes used to comedic effect  citation needed  . An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for among other things a clever regiment of nerdy young men. Contrived acronyms  edit  Acronyms are sometimes contrived , that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word. Some examples of contrived acronyms are USA PATRIOT , CAN SPAM , CAPTCHA and ACT UP .  citation needed  The clothing company French Connection began referring to itself as fcuk , standing for French Connection United Kingdom. The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronyms similarity to the taboo word  fuck . The US Department of Defenses Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  DARPA  is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including RESURRECT , NIRVANA , and DUDE . In July 2010, Wired magazine reported that DARPA announced programs to ..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science named BATMAN and ROBIN for Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature and Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks, 78  a reference to the Batman and Robin comic-book superheroes. The short-form names of clinical trials and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as names within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of mnemonic reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in medicine include the ALLHAT trial Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial and the CHARM trial Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity. The fact that RAS syndrome is often involved, as well as that the letters often dont entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the archetypal form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the raison dtre of clinical trial acronyms, as with gene and protein symbols , is simply to have a syntactically usable and recallable short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not memorized . It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of cutesy examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short names chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a name , rather than being a cryptic and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been 1 that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document, 79  and 2 that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication. 79  At least one study has evaluated the citation impact and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others, 80  finding both good aspects mnemonic help, name recall and potential flaws  connotatively driven bias . 80  Some acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable For example, Verliebt in Berlin  ViB , a German telenovela , was first intended to be Alles nur aus Liebe  All for Love , but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym ANAL . Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as CLaIT , 81  rather than CLIT . In Canada, the Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance Party was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP pronounced see crap . The satirical magazine Frank had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and NSDAP . Two Irish Institutes of Technology Galway and Tralee chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee ITT, as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology  TIT . Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology GMIT, as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology  GIT . The charity sports organization Team in Training is known as TNT and not TIT. Technological Institute of Textile  Sciences is still known as TITS. George Mason University was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law  ASSOL  in honor of the late Antonin Scalia , only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later. 82  Macronymsnested acronyms  edit  A macronym , or nested acronym , is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms or abbreviations themselves. The word macronym is a portmanteau of  macro-  and acronym. Some examples of macronyms are XHR stands for XML HTTP Request, in which  XML  is Extensible Markup Language, and HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol POWER stands for Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC, in which  RISC  stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing VHDL stands for VHSIC Hardware Description Language, in which  VHSIC  stands for Very High Speed Integrated Circuit XSD stands for XML Schema Definition, in which  XML  stands for Extensible Markup Language AIM stands for AOL Instant Messenger, in which  AOL  originally stood for America Online HASP stood for Houston Automatic Spooling Priority, but  spooling  itself was an acronym simultaneous peripheral operations on-line Some macronyms can be multiply nested the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine New Scientist , a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all RARS is the Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service ATOVS is Advanced TOVS TOVS is  TIROS operational vertical sounder and TIROS is Television infrared observational satellite. 83  Fully expanded, RARS might thus become Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service. Another example is VITAL , which expands to  VHDL Initiative Towards ASIC Libraries a total of 15 words when fully expanded. However, to say that RARS stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in syntax in the same way that CHF can be usefully interchanged with congestive heart failure, is a prescriptive misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description the true nature of such a term is closer to anacronymic than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations, but the former are irreducible in that respect they can be annotated with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words laser and radar function as words in syntax and cognition without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as RARS and  CHA2DS2VASc score  are irreducible in natural language  if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, protein and gene nomenclature, which uses symbols extensively , includes such terms as the name of the NACHT protein domain , which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domainNAIP NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein, C2TA major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator, HET-E incompatibility locus protein from Podospora anserine , and TP1 telomerase-associated proteinbut is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a name within a clause clearly parsable by human readers or listeners. Recursive acronyms  edit  Main article Recursive acronym A special type of macronym, the recursive acronym , has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in The Hackers Dictionary as MUNG , which stands for MUNG Until No Good. Some examples of recursive acronyms are GNU stands for GNUs Not Unix LAME stands for LAME Aint an MP3 Encoder PHP stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor WINE stands for WINE Is Not an Emulator HURD stands for HIRD of Unix-replacing daemons, where HIRD itself stands for HURD of interfaces representing depth a mutually recursive acronym Non-English languages  edit  Specific languages  edit  Chinese  edit  In English language discussions of languages with syllabic or logographic writing systems such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, acronyms describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word. For example, in Chinese, university     , literally great learning is usually abbreviated simply as  great when used with the name of the institute. So  Peking University     is commonly shortened to   lit. north-great by also only taking the first character of Peking , the northern capital    Beijing . In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of  Hong Kong University     uses Kong    rather than Hong. There are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of Chinas highest ruling council, the Politburo Standing Committee PSC, is Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China   . The term then reduced the Communist Party of China part of its name through acronyms, then the Standing Committee part, again through acronyms, to create   . Alternatively, it omitted the Communist Party part altogether, creating Politburo Standing Committee   , and eventually just Standing Committee   . The PSCs members full designations are Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China    this was eventually drastically reduced to simply Changwei   , with the term Ruchang    used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word     National Peoples Congress  can be broken into four parts     the whole nation,     people,     representatives,     conference. Yet, in its short form    literally manpeople big, only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected the first part    and the third part    are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term initialism is inapplicable.  original research  Many proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the CCTV New Years Gala , whose full name is literally read as China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala    was first shortened to Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala   , but eventually referred to as simply Chunwan   . Along the same vein, Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai    was reduced to Yangshi    in the mid-2000s. Korean  edit  Many aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages commonalities, like using the word for big or great i.e. dae   , to refer to universities    daehak, literally great learning although big school is an acceptable alternate. They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as UPenn or Texas Tech. Some acronyms are shortened forms of the schools name, like how Hongik University   , Hongik Daehakgyo  is shortened to Hongdae   , Hong, the big school or Hong-U Other acronyms can refer to the universitys main subject, e.g. Korea National University of Education   , Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo  is shortened to Gyowondae , Big Ed. or Ed.-U. Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology   , Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon  is referred to as KAIST   , Kaiseuteu  in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY , seukai , combining the first letter of their English names  S eoul National, K orea, and Y onsei Universities. In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test   , Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom  is shortened to Suneung   , S.A.. Japanese  edit  Main article Japanese abbreviated and contracted words The Japanese language makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms. Chinese-based words  Sino-Japanese vocabulary  uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like Tdai    for Tky Daigaku   , Tokyo University  . In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in Saiky for , from Saitama  Tkyo    , rather than Sai t . Non-Chinese foreign borrowings  gairaigo  are instead frequently abbreviated as clipped compounds , rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in katakana transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words written in hiragana . For example, the Pokmon media franchises name originally stood for pocket monsters      po-ke-tto-mon-su-t   , which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and  wpuro  stands for  word processor       w-do-pu-ro-se-ss  . German  edit  To a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are Gestapo rather than GSP for Geheime Staatspolizei , Secret State Police Flak rather than FAK for Fliegerabwehrkanone , anti-aircraft gun Kripo rather than KP for Kriminalpolizei , detective division police. The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled Akfi for Abkrzungsfimmel , strange habit of abbreviating. Examples of Akfi include Vokuhila for vorne kurz, hinten lang , short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a mullet  and the mocking of Adolf Hitler s title as Grfaz  Grter Feldherr aller Zeiten , Greatest General of all Times. Hebrew  edit  Main article Hebrew acronyms It is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym regardless of this, the abbreviation sign gershayim   is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word. Examples keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left   for   , the United States   for   , the Soviet Union   for   , Rishon LeZion    for   , the school. An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is    Tzahal , for    , Israel Defense Forces . In inflected forms the abbreviation sign gershayim remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym e.g. report, singular  , plural   squad commander, masculine  , feminine  . Indonesian  edit  See also List of Indonesian acronyms and abbreviations There is also a widespread use of acronyms in Indonesia in every aspect of social life. For example, the Golkar political party stands for Partai Golongan Karya, Monas stands for Monumen Nasional National Monument, the Angkot public transport stands for Angkutan Kota  city public transportation , warnet stands for warung internet  internet cafe , and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal or officially adopted, while many more are considered informal, slang or colloquial . The capitals metropolitan area  Jakarta and its surrounding satellite regions , Jabodetabek , is another infamous acronym. This stands for Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-Bekasi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method e.g. Jalan Tol Toll Road Jagorawi Jakarta-Bogor-Ciawi and Purbaleunyi Purwakarta-Bandung-Cileunyi, Joglo Semar Jogja-solo-semarang. In some languages, especially those that use certain alphabets , many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The Indonesian military TNI Tentara Nasional Indonesia  and Indonesian police POLRI Kepolisian Republik Indonesia  are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the Kopassus  Komando Pasukan Khusus  Special Forces Command, Kopaska  Komando Pasukan Katak  Frogmen Command, Kodim  Komando Distrik Militer  Military District Commandone of the Indonesian armys administrative divisions , Serka  Sersan Kepala  Head Sergeant , Akmil  Akademi Militer  Military Academyin Magelang  and many other terms regarding ranks , units, divisions, procedures, etc. Russian  edit  Acronyms that use parts of words not necessarily syllables are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g.   Gazprom , for    Gazovaya promyshlennost , gas industry. There are also initialisms, such as   SMI , for    sredstva massovoy informatsii , means of mass informing, i.e. mass media . Another Russian acronym,   GULag  combines two initials and three letters of the final word it stands for     Glavnoe upravlenie lagerey , Chief Administration of Camps. Historically,  OTMA  was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia and his consort, Alexandra Feodorovna , as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girls name in the order of their births Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia. Swahili  edit  In Swahili , acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili the Institute for Swahili Research. Multiple initial letters often the initial syllable of words are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others. Vietnamese  edit  In Vietnamese , which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include TP.HCM  Thnh ph H Ch Minh , Ho Chi Minh City , THPT  trung hc ph thng , high school, CLB  cu lc b , club, CSDL  c s d liu , database, NXB  nh xut bn , publisher, BACE  ng b anh ch em , a general form of address, and CTTVN  cc Thnh t o Vit Nam , Vietnamese Martyrs . Longer examples include CHXHCNVN  Cng ha X hi ch ngha Vit Nam , Socialist Republic of Vietnam  and MTDTGPMNVN  Mt trn Dn tc Gii phng min Nam Vit Nam , Viet Cong . Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in Vietnam , for example TTLT-VKSNDTC-TANDTC . 84  It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article. Each letter in an initialism corresponds to one morpheme that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example NA or N for ng Nam   Southeast Asia  and LMCA or LMC for Lin minh chu u  European Union . The letter    is often replaced by W in initialisms to avoid confusion with U, for example UBTWMTTQVN or UBTMTTQVN for y ban Trung ng Mt trn T quc Vit Nam Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front . Initialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the names of many Vietnamese letters are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include SIA  pronounced   si a , a respelling of the French acronym SIDA  AIDS  VOA  pronounced   vwa , a literal reading of the English initialism for Voice of America  and NASA  pronounced   na za , borrowed directly from the English acronym. As in Chinese , many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term Vit Cng is derived from the first syllables of Vit Nam Vietnam and Cng sn communist. This mechanism is limited to Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary . Unlike with Chinese, such clipped compounds are considered to be portmanteau words or blend words rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the Vietnamese alphabet still requires each component word to be written as more than one character. General grammatical considerations  edit  Declension  edit  In languages where nouns are declined , various methods are used. An example is Finnish , where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters An acronym is pronounced as a word Nato nato  Natoon naton into Nato, Nasalta from NASA  An acronym is pronounced as letters EU e u  EUhun e uhun into EU An acronym is interpreted as words EU europan unioni  EUiin europan unionin into EU The process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus pre-NATO policy rather than preNATO . Lenition  edit  In languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Irish , where lenition initial consonant mutation is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case h is often added after the initial consonant for example, BBC Scotland in the genitive case would be written as BhBC Alba , with the acronym pronounced VBC . Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for television  gd telebhisean  is TBh , pronounced TV , as in English. Extremes  edit  The longest acronym, according to the 1965 edition of Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary , is ADCOMSUBORDCOMPHIBSPAC, a United States Navy term that stands for Administrative Command, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet Subordinate Command. Another term COMNAVSEACOMBATSYSENGSTA, which stands for Commander, Naval Sea Systems Combat Engineering Station is longer but the word Combat is not shortened. The worlds longest acronym, according to the Guinness Book of World Records , is  NIIOMTPLABOPARMBETZHELBETRABSBOMONIMONKONOTDTEKHSTROMONT . However, this is more precisely a combination acronym clipped compound , as multiple initial letters of some constituent words are used. The 56-letter term 54 in Cyrillic  is from the Concise Dictionary of Soviet Terminology and means The laboratory for shuttering, reinforcement, concrete and ferroconcrete operations for composite-monolithic and monolithic constructions of the Department of the Technology of Building-assembly operations of the Scientific Research Institute of the Organization for building mechanization and technical aid of the Academy of Building and Architecture of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics .  - ...           -      -   The card-game Magic The Gathering has a playing card called Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental, with text on it saying Just call it OMRSTPLRLCNSWMTCTHTALCNEE for short. 85  See also  edit  Acronyms in healthcare Acronyms in the Philippines Acrostic Amalgamation names Astronomical acronyms Initialized sign Internet slang Lists of abbreviations List of abbreviations in photography List of acronyms List of fictional espionage organizations List of Japanese Latin alphabetic abbreviations -onym Syllabic abbreviation Notes  edit   This change was also applied to other languages, with Poulet Frit Kentucky becoming PFK in French Canada.

Usage Problem An initialism. Usage Note In strict usage, the term acronym refers to a word made from the initial letters or parts of other words, such as sonar from sound navigation and ranging. The distinguishing feature of an acronym is that it is pronounced as if it were a single word, in the manner of NATO and NASA.
