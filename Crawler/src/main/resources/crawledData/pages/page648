Creativity From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For other uses, see Creativity disambiguation . A picture of a lightbulb is associated to someone having an idea, a sign of creativity. Creativity is a phenomenon whereby something new and somehow valuable is formed. The created item may be intangible such as an idea , a scientific theory , a musical composition , or a joke  or a physical object such as an invention , a literary work , or a painting . Scholarly interest in creativity is found in a number of disciplines, primarily psychology , business studies , and cognitive science , but also education , technology , engineering , philosophy particularly philosophy of science , theology , sociology , linguistics , and economics , covering the relations between creativity and general intelligence , personality type, mental and neurological processes, mental health, or artificial intelligence  the potential for fostering creativity through education and training the fostering of creativity for national economic benefit, and the application of creative resources to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning.

The word create appeared in English as early as the 14th century, notably in Chaucer, to indicate divine creation 1  in The Parsons Tale 2  . However, its modern meaning as an act of human creation did not emerge until after the Enlightenment . 1  Definition  edit  In a summary of scientific research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested Over the course of the last decade, however, we seem to have reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products Mumford, 2003, p.  110, 3  or, in Robert Sternberg s words, the production of something original and worthwhile. 4  Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. 5  As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on identifying the difficulty searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them and finally communicating the results. 6  Creativity in general is usually distinguished from innovation in particular, where the stress is on implementation. For example, Teresa Amabile and Pratt 2016 defines creativity as production of novel and useful ideas and innovation as implementation of creative ideas, 7  while the OECD and Eurostat state that Innovation is more than a new idea or an invention. An innovation requires implementation, either by being put into active use or by being made available for use by other parties, firms, individuals or organisations. 8  Aspects  edit  Theories of creativity particularly investigation of why some people are more creative than others have focused on a variety of aspects. The dominant factors are usually identified as the four Ps  process, product, person, and place according to Mel Rhodes . 9  A focus on process is shown in cognitive approaches that try to describe thought mechanisms and techniques for creative thinking. Theories invoking divergent rather than convergent thinking such as Guilford , or those describing the staging of the creative process such as Wallas  are primarily theories of creative process. A focus on creative product usually appears in attempts to measure creativity psychometrics, see below and in creative ideas framed as successful memes . 10  The psychometric approach to creativity reveals that it also involves the ability to produce more. 11  A focus on the nature of the creative person considers more general intellectual habits, such as openness, levels of ideation , autonomy, expertise, exploratory behavior, and so on. A focus on place considers the circumstances in which creativity flourishes, such as degrees of autonomy, access to resources, and the nature of gatekeepers. Creative lifestyles are characterized by nonconforming attitudes and behaviors as well as flexibility. 11  Conceptual history  edit  Main article History of the concept of creativity Greek philosophers like Plato rejected the concept of creativity, preferring to see art as a form of discovery. Asked in The Republic , Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something, Plato answers, Certainly not, he merely imitates . 12  Ancient  edit  Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece , 12  Ancient China , and Ancient India , 13  lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to to create or creator except for the expression  poiein  to make, which only applied to poiesis poetry and to the poietes poet, or maker who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in The Republic , 14  Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something, he answers, Certainly not, he merely imitates . 12  It is commonly argued that the notion of creativity originated in Western culture through Christianity , as a matter of divine inspiration . 1  According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin , the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the Genesis . 15  However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance . In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of Gods work. 16  A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods. 17  Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative  daemon  Greek or  genius  Latin, linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance . 18  It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of  great men . 18  Post-Enlightenment  edit  The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later. 16  The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance , when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named humanism , which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual. 19  From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man or polymath, an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation. 20  One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci . However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment. 18  By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment , mention of creativity notably in aesthetics , linked with the concept of imagination , became more frequent. 21  In the writing of Thomas Hobbes , imagination became a key element of human cognition 1  William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius , typifying the separation being made between talent productive, but breaking no new ground and genius. 17  As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century. 17  Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism . In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton , who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius. 1  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz 1896 and Henri Poincar 1908 began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes. Modern  edit  The insights of Poincar and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas 22  and Max Wertheimer . In his work Art of Thought , published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages i preparation preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individuals mind on the problem and explores the problems dimensions, ii incubation where the problem is internalized into the unconscious mind and nothing appears externally to be happening, iii intimation the creative person gets a feeling that a solution is on its way, iv illumination or insight where the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness v verification where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied. Wallas model is often treated as four stages, with intimation seen as a sub-stage. Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton 23  provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, Origins of genius Darwinian perspectives on creativity . In 1927, Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as Process and Reality . 24  He is credited with having coined the term creativity to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme Whitehead actually coined the term  our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead o f all people, quickly became occluded. 25  Although psychometric studies of creativity had been conducted by The London School of Psychology as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination, 26  the formal psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford s address to the American Psychological Association in 1950. 27  The address helped to popularize the study of creativity and to focus attention on scientific approaches to conceptualizing creativity. Statistical analyses led to the recognition of creativity as measured as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ -type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilfords work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down. 28  Four C model  edit  James C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a four C model of creativity mini-c transformative learning involving personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights, little-c everyday problem solving and creative expression, Pro-C exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent and Big-C creativity considered great in the given field. This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals. 29  The contrast of terms Big C and Little c has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-cBig-C model to review major theories of creativity. 28  Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity historical and p-creativity personal. 30  Robinson 31  and Anna Craft 32  have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between high and little c creativity. 32  and cites Ken Robinson as referring to high and democratic creativity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi 33  has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity. 34  Process theories  edit  There has been much empirical study in psychology and cognitive science of the processes through which creativity occurs. Interpretation of the results of these studies has led to several possible explanations of the sources and methods of creativity. Incubation  edit  Incubation is a temporary break from creative problem solving that can result in insight. 35  There has been some empirical research looking at whether, as the concept of incubation in Wallas  model implies, a period of interruption or rest from a problem may aid creative problem-solving. Ward 36  lists various hypotheses that have been advanced to explain why incubation may aid creative problem-solving, and notes how some empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that incubation aids creative problem in that it enables forgetting of misleading clues. Absence of incubation may lead the problem solver to become fixated on inappropriate strategies of solving the problem. 37  This work disputes the earlier hypothesis that creative solutions to problems arise mysteriously from the unconscious mind while the conscious mind is occupied on other tasks. 38  This earlier hypothesis is discussed in Csikszentmihalyi s five phase model of the creative process which describes incubation as a time that your unconscious takes over. This allows for unique connections to be made without our consciousness trying to make logical order out of the problem. 39  Convergent and divergent thinking  edit  J. P. Guilford 40  drew a distinction between convergent and divergent production commonly renamed convergent and divergent thinking . Convergent thinking involves aiming for a single, correct solution to a problem, whereas divergent thinking involves creative generation of multiple answers to a set problem. Divergent thinking is sometimes used as a synonym for creativity in psychology literature. Other researchers have occasionally used the terms flexible thinking or fluid intelligence , which are roughly similar to but not synonymous with creativity. 41  Creative cognition approach  edit  In 1992, Finke et al. proposed the Geneplore model, in which creativity takes place in two phases a generative phase, where an individual constructs mental representations called preinventive structures, and an exploratory phase where those structures are used to come up with creative ideas. Some evidence shows that when people use their imagination to develop new ideas, tho se ideas are heavily structured in predictable ways by the properties of existing categories and concepts. 42  Weisberg 43  argued, by contrast, that creativity only involves ordinary cognitive processes yielding extraordinary results. The ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory  edit  Helie and Sun 44  more recently proposed a unified framework for understanding creativity in problem solving , namely the ExplicitImplicit Interaction EII theory of creativity. This new theory constitutes an attempt at providing a more unified explanation of relevant phenomena in part by reinterpretingintegrating various fragmentary existing theories of incubation and insight . The EII theory relies mainly on five basic principles, namely The co-existence of and the difference between explicit and implicit knowledge The simultaneous involvement of implicit and explicit processes in most tasks The redundant representation of explicit and implicit knowledge The integration of the results of explicit and implicit processing The iterative and possibly bidirectional processing. A computational implementation of the theory was developed based on the CLARION cognitive architecture and used to simulate relevant human data. This work represents an initial step in the development of process-based theories of creativity encompassing incubation, insight, and various other related phenomena. Conceptual blending  edit  Main article Conceptual blending In The Act of Creation , Arthur Koestler introduced the concept of bisociation  that creativity arises as a result of the intersection of two quite different frames of reference. 45  This idea was later developed into conceptual blending. In the 1990s, various approaches in cognitive science that dealt with metaphor , analogy , and structure mapping have been converging, and a new integrative approach to the study of creativity in science, art and humor has emerged under the label conceptual blending . Honing theory  edit  Honing theory, developed principally by psychologist Liane Gabora , posits that creativity arises due to the self-organizing, self-mending nature of a worldview. The creative process is a way in which the individual hones and re-hones an integrated worldview. Honing theory places emphasis not only on the externally visible creative outcome but also the internal cognitive restructuring and repair of the worldview brought about by the creativ e process. When faced with a creatively demanding task, there is an interaction between the conception of the task and the worldview. The conception of the task changes through interaction with the worldview, and the worldview changes through interaction with the task. This interaction is reiterated until the task is complete, at which point not only is the task conceived of di fferently, but the worldview is subtly or drastically transformed as it follows the natural tendency of a worldview to attempt to resolve dissonance and seek internal consistency amongst its components, whether they be ideas, attitudes, or bits of knowledge. A central feature of honing theory is the notion of a potentiality state. 46  Honing theory posits that creative thought proceeds not by searching through and randomly mutating predefined possibilities, but by drawing upon associations that exist due to overlap in the distributed neural cell assemblies that participate in the encoding of experiences in memory. Midway through the creative process one may have made associations between the current task and previous experiences, but not yet disambiguated which aspects of those previous experiences are relevant to the current task. Thus the creative idea may feel half-baked. It is at that point that it can be said to be in a potentiality state, because how it will actualize depends on the different internally or externally generated contexts it interacts with. Honing theory is held to explain certain phenomena not dealt with by other theories of creativity, for example, how different works by the same creator are observed in studies to exhibit a recognizable style or voice even though in different creative outlets. This is not predicted by theories of creativity that emphasize chance processes or the accumulation of expertise, but it is predicted by honing theory, according to which personal style reflects the creators uniquely structured worldview. Another example is in the environmental stimulus for creativity. Creativity is commonly considered to be fostered by a supportive, nurturing, trustworthy environment conducive to self-actualization. However, research shows that creativity is also associated with childhood adversity, which would stimulate honing. Everyday imaginative thought  edit  In everyday thought, people often spontaneously imagine alternatives to reality when they think if only.... 47  Their counterfactual thinking is viewed as an example of everyday creative processes. 48  It has been proposed that the creation of counterfactual alternatives to reality depends on similar cognitive processes to rational thought. 49  Personal assessment  edit  Creativity quotient  edit  There was a creativity quotient developed similar to the intelligence quotient IQ. It makes use of the results of divergent thinking tests see below by processing them further. It gives more weight to ideas that are radically different from other ideas in the response. 50  Psychometric approach  edit  J. P. Guilford s group, 40  which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967 Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles. Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness. Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings these were scored for uncommonness. Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks. Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words e.g. Hand _____ Call Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events e.g. loss of gravity Originally, Guilford was trying to create a model for intellect as a whole, but in doing so also created a model for creativity. Guilford made an important assumption for creative research creativity isnt one abstract concept.  The idea that creativity is a category rather than one single concept opened up the ability for other researchers to look at creativity with a whole new perspective. 51  52  Additionally, Guilford hypothesized one of the first models for the components of creativity.  He explained that creativity was a result of having Sensitivity to problems, or the ability to recognize problems Fluency, which encompasses a. Ideational fluency, or the ability rapidly to produce a variety of ideas that fulfill stated requirements b. Associational fluency, or the ability to generate a list of words, each of which is associated with a given word                     c. Expressional fluency, or the ability to organize words into larger units, such as phrases, sentences, and paragraphs Flexibility, which encompasses                       a. Spontaneous flexibility, or the ability to demonstrate flexibility                           b. Adaptive flexibility, or the ability to produce responses that are novel and high in quality. This represents the base model by which several researchers would take and alter to produce their new theories of creativity years later. 51  Building on Guilfords work, Torrance 53  developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in 1966. 54  They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on Fluency  The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus. Originality  The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects. Elaboration  The amount of detail in the responses. Such tests, sometimes called Divergent Thinking DT tests have been both supported 55  and criticized. 56  Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality. 57  58  The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders. Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures. 59  Most recently, an NSF-funded 60  team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco 61  combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system. This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported. 56  The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders. 62  Social-personality approach  edit  Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals. 27  A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive. Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed. 63  Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged. 64  Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity. 65  Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, conscientious , and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists. 63  Self-report questionnaires  edit  An alternative is using biographical methods. These methods use quantitative characteristics such as the number of publications, patents, or performances of a work. While this method was originally developed for highly creative personalities, today it is also available as self-report questionnaires supplemented with frequent, less outstanding creative behaviors such as writing a short story or creating your own recipes. For example, the Creative Achievement Questionnaire , a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output. 66  Besides the English original, it was also used in a Chinese, 67  French, 68  and German-speaking 69  version. It is the self-report questionnaire most frequently used in research. 67  Intelligence  edit  The potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies  from Getzels  Jackson, 70  Barron , 71  Wallach  Kogan, 72  and Guilford 73   focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why. 74  There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows Threshold Theory  Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ 120. 71  73  Certification Theory  Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of educationwork, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative. Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence. 75  Interference Theory  Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability. 76  Sternberg and OHara 77  proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence Creativity is a subset of intelligence Intelligence is a subset of creativity Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct coincident sets Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs disjoint sets Creativity as a subset of intelligence  edit  A number of researchers include creativity, either explicitly or implicitly, as a key component of intelligence. Examples of theories that include creativity as a subset of intelligence Sternbergs Theory of Successful intelligence 76  77  78  see Triarchic theory of intelligence  includes creativity as a main component, and comprises 3 sub-theories Componential Analytic, Contextual Practical, and Experiential Creative. Experiential sub-theory  the ability to use pre-existing knowledge and skills to solve new and novel problems  is directly related to creativity. The CattellHornCarroll theory includes creativity as a subset of intelligence. Specifically, it is associated with the broad group factor of long-term storage and retrieval Glr. Glr narrow abilities relating to creativity include 79  ideational fluency, associational fluency, and originalitycreativity. Silvia et al. 80  conducted a study to look at the relationship between divergent thinking and verbal fluency tests, and reported that both fluency and originality in divergent thinking were significantly affected by the broad level Glr factor. Martindale 81  extended the CHC-theory in the sense that it was proposed that those individuals who are creative are also selective in their processing speed Martindale argues that in the creative process, larger amounts of information are processed more slowly in the early stages, and as the individual begins to understand the problem, the processing speed is increased. The Dual Process Theory of Intelligence 82  posits a two-factortype model of intelligence. Type 1 is a conscious process, and concerns goal directed thoughts, which are explained by g . Type 2 is an unconscious process, and concerns spontaneous cognition, which encompasses daydreaming and implicit learning ability. Kaufman argues that creativity occurs as a result of Type 1 and Type 2 processes working together in combination. The use of each type in the creative process can be used to varying degrees. Intelligence as a subset of creativity  edit  In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity. Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity Sternberg  Lubarts Investment Theory. 83  84  Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors  they buy low and sell high in their ideas. Like underlow-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others , and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual sells high by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six fac tors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts. Amabiles Componential Model of Creativity. 85  86  In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity  domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation  and 1 component external to the individual their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is intrinsically motivated, possesses bo th a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment. Amusement Park Theoretical Model. 87  In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements e.g., timetransport to go to the park. Initial requirements like intelligence are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement intelligence, then they will not be able to generate creative thoughtsbehaviour. Secondly are the subcomponents  general thematic areas  that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit e.g. a zoo or a water park, these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative e.g. poetry. Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc. that have to be selected from. Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem  individual rides at the waterpark. Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs  edit  This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs. Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs Renzullis Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness. 88  In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions. PASS theory of intelligence . In this theory, the planning component  relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action  strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity. 89  Threshold Theory TT. A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence  both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of 120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak. 70  71  90  TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity. In support of the TT, Barron 71  91  reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto 92  in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of r  .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al. 93  in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from r  .19 to r  .49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were r  .12. Cho et al. 94  reported a correlation of .40 between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults and a correlation of close to r  .0 for the high IQ group. Jauk et al. 95  found support for the TT, but only for measures of creative potential not creative performance. Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al. 96  in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth  a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood  found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kims 97  meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQs of 120. Preckel et al., 98  investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of r  .3 to r  .4 across all levels of cognitive ability. Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets  edit  Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence problem solving are the same thing. Perkins 99  referred to this as the nothing-special view. Weisberg  Alba 100  examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem see Thinking outside the boxNine dots puzzle   where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve t he problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight or creativity that is required. Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets  edit  In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs. Getzels and Jackson 70  administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered by the school IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was r  .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20 of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20 of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite they scored in the top 20 for IQ, but were outside the top 20 scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated. However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan 72  highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ, but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar 101  noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests. Wallach and Kogan 72  administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner aiming to facilitate creativity. Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average r  .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average r  .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated r  .09. Neuroscience  edit  The neuroscience of creativity looks at the operation of the brain during creative behaviour. It has been addressed 102  in the article Creative Innovation Possible Brain Mechanisms. The authors write that creative innovation might require coactivation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected. Highly creative people who excel at creative innovation tend to differ from others in three ways they have a high level of specialized knowledge, they are capable of divergent thinking mediated by the frontal lobe . and they are able to modulate neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in their frontal lobe. Thus, the frontal lobe appears to be the part of the cortex that is most important for creativity. This article also explored the links between creativity and sleep, mood and addiction disorders , and depression . In 2005, Alice Flaherty presented a three-factor model of the creative drive. Drawing from evidence in brain imaging, drug studies and lesion analysis, she described the creative drive as resulting from an interaction of the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes , and dopamine from the limbic system . The frontal lobes can be seen as responsible for idea generation, and the temporal lobes for idea editing and evaluation. Abnormalities in the frontal lobe such as depression or anxiety generally decrease creativity, while abnormalities in the temporal lobe often increase creativity. High activity in the temporal lobe typically inhibits activity in the frontal lobe, and vic e versa. High dopamine levels increase general arousal and goal directed behaviors and reduce latent inhibition , and all three effects increase the drive to generate ideas. 103  A 2015 study on creativity found that it involves the interaction of multiple neural networks, including those that support associative thinking, along with other default mode network functions. 104  Working memory and the cerebellum  edit  Vandervert 105  described how the brains frontal lobes and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum collaborate to produce creativity and innovation. Vanderverts explanation rests on considerable evidence that all processes of working memory responsible for processing all thought 106   are adaptively modeled for increased efficiency by the cerebellum. 107  The cerebellum consisting of 100 billion neurons, which is more than the entirety of the rest of the brain 108   is also widely known to adaptively model all bodily movement for efficiency. The cerebellums adaptive models of working memory processing are then fed back to especially frontal lobe working memory control processes 109  where creative and innovative thoughts arise. 110  Apparently, creative insight or the aha experience is then triggered in the temporal lobe. 111   According to Vandervert, the details of creative adaptation begin in forward cerebellar models which are anticipatoryexploratory controls for movement and thought. These cerebellar processing and control architectures have been termed Hierarchical Modular Selection and Identification for Control HMOSAIC. 112  New, hierarchically arranged levels of the cerebellar control architecture HMOSAIC develop as mental mulling in working memory is extended over time. These new levels of the control architecture are fed forward to the frontal lobes. Since the cerebellum adaptively models all movement and all levels of thought and emotion, 113  Vanderverts approach helps explain creativity and innovation in sports, art, music, the design of video games, technology, mathematics, the child prodigy , and thought in general. Essentially, Vandervert has argued that when a person is confronted with a challenging new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. 114  Most recently, he has argued that this is the same process only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization that led to the evolution of language in humans. 115  Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology. 116  Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive mental prototyping or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the self-driven, individualized patt erning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy . The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors. 117  118  REM sleep  edit  Creativity involves the forming of associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. Sleep aids this process. 119  REM rather than NREM sleep appears to be responsible. 120  121  This has been suggested to be due to changes in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation that occurs during REM sleep. 120  During this period of sleep, high levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from the hippocampus to the neocortex , and lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the spread of associational activity within neocortical areas without control from the hippocampus. 122  This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. It is proposed that REM sleep adds creativity by allowing neocortical structures to reorganize associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representat ions or nodes. 120  Affect  edit  Some theories suggest that creativity may be particularly susceptible to affective influence. As noted in voting behavior , the term affect in this context can refer to liking or disliking key aspects of the subject in question. This work largely follows from findings in psychology regarding the ways in which affective states are involved in human judgment and decision-making. 123  Positive affect relations  edit  According to Alice Isen , positive affect has three primary effects on cognitive activity Positive affect makes additional cognitive material available for processing, increasing the number of cognitive elements available for association Positive affect leads to defocused attention and a more complex cognitive context, increasing the breadth of those elements that are treated as relevant to the problem Positive affect increases cognitive flexibility, increasing the probability that diverse cognitive elements will in fact become associated. Together, these processes lead positive affect to have a positive influence on creativity. Barbara Fredrickson in her broaden-and-build model suggests that positive emotions such as joy and love broaden a persons available repertoire of cognitions and actions, thus enhancing creativity. According to these researchers, positive emotions increase the number of cognitive elements available for association attention scope and the number of elements that are relevant to the problem cognitive scope. Various meta-analyses, such as Baas et al. 2008 of 66 studies about creativity and affect support the link between creativity and positive affect. 124  125  Artificial intelligence  edit  Jrgen Schmidhuber s formal theory of creativity 126  127  postulates that creativity, curiosity, and interestingness are by-products of a simple computational principle for measuring and optimizing learning progress. Consider an agent able to manipulate its environment and thus its own sensory inputs. The agent can use a black box optimization method such as reinforcement learning to learn through informed trial and error sequences of actions that maximize the expected sum of its future reward signals. There are extrinsic reward signals for achieving externally given goals, such as finding food when hungry. But Schmidhubers objective function to be maximized also includes an additional, intrinsic term to model wow-effects. This non-standard term motivates purely creative behavior of the agent even when there are no external goals. A wow-effect is formally defined as follows. As the agent is creating and predicting and encoding the continually growing history of actions and sensory inputs, it keeps improving the p redictor or encoder, which can be implemented as an artificial neural network or some other machine learning device that can exploit regularities in the data to improve its performance over time. The improvements can be measured precisely, by computing the difference in computational costs storage size, number of required synapses, errors, time needed to encode new observations before and after learning. This difference depends on the encoders present subjective knowledge, which c hanges over time, but the theory formally takes this into account. The cost difference measures the strength of the present wow-effect due to sudden improvements in data compression or computational speed. It becomes an intrinsic reward signal for the action selector. The objective function thus motivates the action optimizer to create action sequences causing more wow-effects. Irregular, random data or noise do not permit any wow-effects or learning progress, and thus are boring by nature providing no reward. Already known and predictable regularit ies also are boring. Temporarily interesting are only the initially unknown, novel, regular patterns in both actions and observations. This motivates the agent to perform continual, open-ended, active, creative exploration. According to Schmidhuber, his objective function explains the activities of scientists, artists, and comedians . 128  129  For example, physicists are motivated to create experiments leading to observations obeying previously unpublished physical laws permitting better data compression . Likewise, composers receive intrinsic reward for creating non-arbitrary melodies with unexpected but regular harmonies that permit wow-effects through data compression improvements. Similarly, a comedian gets intrinsic reward for inventing a novel joke with an unexpected punch line , related to the beginning of the story in an initially unexpected but quickly learnable way that also allows for better compression of the perceived data. 130  Schmidhuber argues that ongoing computer hardware advances will greatly scale up rudimentary artificial scientists and artists  clarification needed  based on simple implementations of the basic principle since 1990. 131  He used the theory to create low-complexity art 132  and an attractive human face . 133  Creativity and mental health  edit  Main article Creativity and mental illness A study by psychologist J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism . 134  Another study found creativity to be greater in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex , schizotypal individuals were found to have much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex. 135  This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal 136  137  and hypomanic personality 138  and several different measures of creativity. Particularly strong links have been identified between creativity and mood disorders , particularly manic-depressive disorder a.k.a. bipolar disorder  and depressive disorder a.k.a. unipolar disorder . In Touched with Fire Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament , Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers , poets , and artists . She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment , Virginia Woolf who drowned herself when she felt a depressive episode coming on, composer Robert Schumann who died in a mental institution, and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo . A different case study suggested for Schumann a difference between bipolar disorder and creative bipolarity. 139  A study looking at 300,000 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or unipolar depression, and their relatives, found overrepresentation in creative professions for those with bipolar disorder as well as for undiagnosed siblings of those with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. There was no overall overrepresentation, but overrepresentation for artistic occupations, among those diagnosed with schizophrenia. There was no association for those with unipolar depression or their relatives. 140  Another case study suggested a difference between severe mood disorders and creative melancholy, pointing out mild and moderate depression may inspire creative achievements while severe depression inhibits and may even destroy creative activity. 141  Another study involving more than one million people, conducted by Swedish researchers at the Karolinska Institute, reported a number of correlations between creative occupations and mental illnesses. Writers had a higher risk of anxiety and bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, unipolar depression, and substance abuse, and were almost twice as likely as the general population to k ill themselves. Dancers and photographers were also more likely to have bipolar disorder. 142  As a group, those in the creative professions were no more likely to have psychiatric disorders than other people, although they were more likely to have a close relative with a disorder, including anorexia and, to some extent, autism, the Journal of Psychiatric Research reports. 142  According to psychologist Robert Epstein, PhD, creativity can be obstructed through stress. 143  Conversely, research has shown that creative activities such as art therapy, poetry writing, journaling, and reminiscence can promote mental well-being. 144  Personality  edit  Creativity can be expressed in a number of different forms, depending on unique people and environments. A number of different theorists have suggested models of the creative person. One model suggests that there are four Creativity Profiles that can help produce growth, innovation, speed, etc. 145  i Incubate Long-term Development ii Imagine Breakthrough Ideas iii Improve Incremental Adjustments iv Invest Short-term Goals Research by Dr Mark Batey of the Psychometrics at Work Research Group at Manchester Business School has suggested that the creative profile can be explained by four primary creativity traits with narrow facets within each i Idea Generation Fluency, Originality, Incubation and Illumination ii Personality Curiosity and Tolerance for Ambiguity iii Motivation Intrinsic, Extrinsic and Achievement iv Confidence Producing, Sharing and Implementing This model was developed in a sample of 1000 working adults using the statistical techniques of Exploratory Factor Analysis followed by Confirmatory Factor Analysis by Structural Equation Modelling. 146  An important aspect of the creativity profiling approach is to account for the tension between predicting the creative profile of an individual, as characterised by the psychometric approach, and the evidence that team creativity is founded on diversity and difference. 147  One characteristic of creative people, as measured by some psychologists, is what is called divergent production . Divergent production is the ability of a person to generate a diverse assortment, yet an appropriate amount of responses to a given situation. 148  One way of measuring divergent production is by administering the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. 149  The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking assesses the diversity, quantity, and appropriateness of participants responses to a variety of open-ended questions. Other researchers of creativity see the difference in creative people as a cognitive process of dedication to problem solving and developing expertise in the field of their creative expression. Hard working people study the work of people before them and within their current area, become experts in their fields, and then have the ability to add to and build upon previous inform ation in innovative and creative ways. In a study of projects by design students, students who had more knowledge on their subject on average had greater creativity within their projects. 150  The aspect of motivation within a persons personality may predict creativity levels in the person. Motivation stems from two different sources, intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an internal drive within a person to participate or invest as a result of personal interest, desires, hopes, goals, etc. Extrinsic motivation is a drive from outside of a pers on and might take the form of payment, rewards, fame, approval from others, etc. Although extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation can both increase creativity in certain cases, strictly extrinsic motivation often impedes creativity in people. 151  From a personality-traits perspective, there are a number of traits that are associated with creativity in people. 152  Creative people tend to be more open to new experiences, are more self-confident, are more ambitious, self-accepting, impulsive, driven, dominant, and hostile, compared to people with less creativity. From an evolutionary perspective, creativity may be a result of the outcome of years of generating ideas. As ideas are continuously generated, the need to evolve produces a need for new ideas and developments. As a result, people have been creating and developing new, innovative, and creative ideas to build our progress as a society. 153  In studying exceptionally creative people in history, some common traits in lifestyle and environment are often found. Creative people in history usually had supportive parents, but rigid and non-nurturing. Most had an interest in their field at an early age, and most had a highly supportive and skilled mentor in their field of interest. Often the field they chose was relativel y uncharted, allowing for their creativity to be expressed more in a field with less previous information. Most exceptionally creative people devoted almost all of their time and energy into their craft, and after about a decade had a creative breakthrough of fame. Their lives were marked with extreme dedication and a cycle of hard-work and breakthroughs as a result of their de termination. 154  Another theory of creative people is the investment theory of creativity . This approach suggest that there are many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that has been overlooked by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea to the point that it is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way. 155  Malevolent creativity  edit  So called malevolent creativity is associated with the dark side of creativity. 156  This type of creativity is not typically accepted within society and is defined by the intention to cause harm to others through original and innovative means. Malevolent creativity should be distinguished from negative creativity in that negative creativity may unintentionally cause harm to others, whereas malevolent creativity is explicitly malevolently motivated. While it i s often associated with criminal behaviour, it can also be observed in ordinary day-to-day life as lying, cheating and betrayal. 157  Crime  edit  Malevolent creativity is often a key contributor to crime and in its most destructive form can even manifest as terrorism. As creativity requires deviating from the conventional, there is a permanent tension between being creative and producing products that go too far and in some cases to the point of breaking the law. Aggression is a key predictor of malevolent creativity, an d studies have also shown that increased levels of aggression also correlates to a higher likelihood of committing crime. 158  Predictive factors  edit  Although everyone shows some levels of malevolent creativity under certain conditions, those that have a higher propensity towards it have increased tendencies to deceive and manipulate others to their own gain. While malevolent creativity appears to dramatically increase when an individual is placed under unfair conditions, personality, particularly aggressiveness, is also a k ey predictor in anticipating levels of malevolent thinking. Researchers Harris and Reiter-Palmon investigated the role of aggression in levels of malevolent creativity, in particular levels of implicit aggression and the tendency to employ aggressive actions in response to problem solving. The personality traits of physical aggression, conscientiousness, emotional intelligence and implicit aggression all seem to be related with malevolent creativity. 156  Harris and Reiter-Palmons research showed that when subjects were presented with a problem that triggered malevolent creativity, participants high in implicit aggression and low in premeditation expressed the largest number of malevolently-themed solutions. When presented with the more benign problem that triggered prosocial motives of helping others and cooperating, those hi gh in implicit aggression, even if they were high in impulsiveness, were far less destructive in their imagined solutions. They concluded premeditation, more than implicit aggression controlled an individuals expression of malevolent creativity. 159  The current measure for malevolent creativity is the 13-item test Malevolent Creativity Behaviour Scale MCBS 157  Cultural differences in creativity  edit  Creativity is viewed differently in different countries. 160  For example, cross-cultural research centred on Hong Kong found that Westerners view creativity more in terms of the individual attributes of a creative person, such as their aesthetic taste, while Chinese people view creativity more in terms of the social influence of creative people e.g. what they can contribute to society. 161  Mpofu et al. surveyed 28 African languages and found that 27 had no word which directly translated to creativity the exception being Arabic . 162  The principle of linguistic relativity , i.e. that language can affect thought, suggests that the lack of an equivalent word for creativity may affect the views of creativity among speakers of such languages. However, more research would be needed to establish this, and there is certainly no suggestion that this linguistic difference makes people any less or more creative Africa has a rich heritage of creative pursuits such as music , art , and storytelling . Nevertheless, it is true that there has been very little research on creativity in Africa, 163  and there has also been very little research on creativity in Latin America. 164  Creativity has been more thoroughly researched in the northern hemisphere, but here again there are cultural differences, even between countries or groups of countries in close proximity. For example, in Scandinavian countries, creativity is seen as an individual attitude which helps in coping with lifes challenges, 165  while in Germany, creativity is seen more as a process that can be applied to help solve problems. 166  Organizational creativity  edit  Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in Brazil . The leaders among other things wish to cheer and encourage the workers in order to achieve a higher level of creativity. It has been the topic of various research studies to establish that organizational effectiveness depends on the creativity of the workforce to a large extent. For any given organization, measures of effectiveness vary, depending upon its mission, environmental context, nature of work, the product or service it produces, and customer demands. Thus, the first step in evaluating organizational effectiveness is to understand the organization itself  how it functions, how it is structured, and what it emphasizes. Amabile 167  argued that to enhance creativity in business, three components were needed Expertise technical, procedural and intellectual knowledge, Creative thinking skills how flexibly and imaginatively people approach problems, and Motivation especially intrinsic motivation . There are two types of motivation extrinsic motivation  external factors, for example threats of being fired or money as a reward, intrinsic motivation  comes from inside an individual, satisfaction, enjoyment of work, etc. Six managerial practices to encourage motivation are Challenge  matching people with the right assignments Freedom  giving people autonomy choosing means to achieve goals Resources  such as time, money, space, etc. There must be balance fit among resources and people Work group features  diverse , supportive teams, where members share the excitement, willingness to help, and recognize each others talents Supervisory encouragement  recognitions, cheering, praising Organizational support  value emphasis, information sharing, collaboration . Nonaka, who examined several successful Japanese companies, similarly saw creativity and knowledge creation as being important to the success of organizations. 168  In particular, he emphasized the role that tacit knowledge has to play in the creative process. In business, originality is not enough. The idea must also be appropriateuseful and actionable . 169  170  Creative competitive intelligence is a new solution to solve this problem. According to Reijo Siltala it links creativity to innovation process and competitive intelligence to creative workers. Creativity can be encouraged in people and professionals and in the workplace. It is essential for innovation, and is a factor affecting economic growth and businesses. In 2013, the sociologist Silvia Leal Martn, using the Innova 3DX method, suggested measuring the various parameters that encourage creativity and innovation corporate culture, work environment, leadership and management, creativity, self-esteem and optimism, locus of control and learning orientation, motivation, and fear. 171  Similarly, social psychologists, organizational scientists, and management scientists who conduct extensive research on the factors that influence creativity and innovation in teams and organizations have developed integrative theoretical models that emphasize the roles of team composition, team processes, and organizational culture, as well as the mutually reinforcing relationships between them in promoting innovation. 172  173  174  175  The investigation by Loo 2017 176  on creative working in the knowledge economy brings together studies of creativity as delineated in this web page. It offers connections with the sections on the Four C model, Theories of creative processes, Creativity as a subset of intelligence, Creativity and personality, and In organisations It is the last section that the investigation addresses. Research studies of the knowledge economy may be classified into three levels macro, meso and micro. Macro studies refer to investigations at a societal or transnational dimension. Meso studies focus on organisations. Micro investigations centre on the minutiae workings of workers. There is also an interdisciplinary dimension such as research from businesses e.g. Burton-Jones, 1999 Drucker, 1999, economics e.g. Cortada, 1998 Reich, 2001 Florida, 2003, education e.g. Farrell and Fenwick, 2007 Brown, Lauder and Ashton, 2011, human resource management e.g. Davenport, 2005, knowledge and organizational management Alvesson, 2004 Defillippi, Arthur and Lindsay, 2006 Orr, Nutley, Russell, Bain, Hacking and Moran, 2016, sociology, psychology, and knowledge econ omy-related sectors  especially information technology IT software e.g. ORiain, 2004 Nerland, 2008 and advertising e.g. Grabher, 2004 Lury, 2004 Loo, 2017. Loo 2017 studies how individual workers in the knowledge economy use their creativity and know-how in the advertising and IT software sectors. It examines this phenomenon across three developed countries of England, Japan and Singapore to observe global perspectives. Specifically, the study uses qualitative data from semi-structured interviews of the related professionals in the roles of creative directing and copywriting in advertising, and systems software developing and software programme managing. The study offers a conceptual framework Loo, 2017, p.  49 of a two-dimensional matrix of individual and collaborative working styles, and single and multi-contexts. The investigation draws on literature sources from the four disciplines of economics e.g. Reich, 2001 Quah, 2002, management e.g. ,Drucker, 1994 Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995 von Hippel, 2006, sociology e.g. Zuboff, 1988 Bell, 1973 Lash and Urry, 1994 Castells, 2000 Knorr Cetina, 2005, and psychology e.g. Gardner, 1984 Csikszentmihalyi, 1988 Sternberg, Kaufman and Pretz, 2004. The themes arising from the analysis of knowledge work and creativity literature serve to create a distinct theoretical framework of creative knowledge work. These workers apply their cognitive abilities, creative personalities and skill sets in the areas of science, techn ology, or culture industries to invent or discover new possibilities  e.g. a medium, product or service. These work activities may be done individually or collectively. Education, training and encultured environments are necessary for the performance of these creative activities. Acts of creativity are viewed as asking new questions over and above those questions asked by an intelligent person, seeking novelty when reviewing a situation Gardner, 1993, and creating something that is different and novel, i.e. a variation on the idea of existing ideas in a domain Csikszentmihalyi, 1988. This framework is evidenced by the empirical chapters on the micro-workings of creative workers in the two knowledge economy sectors from global perspectives. This investigation identifies a definition of creative work, three types of work and the necessary conditions for it to occur. These workers use a combination of creative applications including anticipatory imagination, problem-solving, problem seeking, and generating ideas and aesthetic sensibilities. Taking aesthetic sensibilities as an example, for a creative director in the advertising industry, it is a visual imagery whether still or moving via a camera lens, and for a software programmer, it is the innovative technical expertise in which the software is written. There are specific creative applications for each of the sectors such as emotional connection in the advertising sector, and the power of expression and sensitivity in the IT software sector. In addition t o the creative applications, creative workers require abilities and aptitudes to carry out their roles. Passion for ones job is generic. For copywriters, this passion is identified with fun, enjoyment and happiness alongside attributes such as honesty regarding the product, confidence, and patience in finding the appropriate copy. Knowledge is also required in the disciplines of the humanities e.g. literature, the creative arts e.g. painting and music and technical-related know-how e.g. mathematics, computer sciences and physical sciences. In the IT software, technical knowledge of computer languages e.g. C is especially significant for programmers whereas the degree of technical expertise may be less for a programme manager, as only knowledge of the releva nt language is necessary to understand the issues for communicating with the team of developers and testers. There are three types of work. One is intra-sectoral e.g. general sponge and in tune with the zeitgeist advertising, and power of expression and sensitivity IT software. The second is inter-sectoral e.g. integration of advertising activities advertising, and autonomous decentralized systems ADS IT software. The third relates to changes in culturepractices in the sectors e.g. three-dimensional trust and green credentials advertising, and collaboration with HEIs and industry and ADS system in the Tokyo train operator IT software. The necessary conditions for creative work to exist are a supportive environment such as supportive information, communications and electronic technologies ICET infrastructure, training, work environment and education. This investigation has implications for lifelong learning of these workers informally and formally. Teaching institutions need to offer multi-disciplinary knowledge of humanities, arts and sciences and it has impacts on the programme structure, delivery approaches and assessments. At a macro level, governments need to offer a rich diet of cultural activities, outdoor activities and sports fixtures that inform potential creative workers in the areas of video gaming and advertising. This study has implications for work organisations that support and encourage collaborative working alongside individual working, offer opportunities to engage in continuous professional development formally and informally, and foster an environment, which promotes experiential functioning a nd supports experimentation. Team composition  edit  Diversity between team members backgrounds and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique information that is available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can integrate in novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by making it more difficult for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. 177  Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity. 172  173  174  175  178  179  Team processes  edit  Team communication norms , such as respecting others expertise, paying attention to others ideas, expecting information sharing, tolerating disagreements, negotiating , remaining open to others ideas, learning from others, and building on each others ideas, increase team creativity by facilitating the social processes involved with brainstorming and problem solving . Through these processes, team members are able to access their collective pool of knowledge, reach shared understandings, identify new ways of understanding problems or tasks, and make new connections between ideas. Engaging in these social processes also promotes positive team affect , which facilitates collective creativity. 172  174  175  178  Organizational culture  edit  Supportive and motivational environments that create psychological safety by encouraging risk taking and tolerating mistakes increase team creativity as well. 172  173  174  175  Organizations in which help-seeking , help giving , and collaboration are rewarded promote innovation by providing opportunities and contexts in which team processes that lead to collective creativity can occur. 180  Additionally, leadership styles that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity. 172  173  174  175  Constraints  edit  There is a long standing debate on how material constraints e.g., lack of money, materials, or equipment affect creativity. In psychological and managerial research, two competing views in this regard prevail. In one view, many scholars propose a negative effect of material constraints on innovation and claim that material constraints starve creativity. 181  The proponents of this view argue that adequate material resources are needed to engage in creative activities like experimenting with new solutions and idea exploration. 181  In an opposing view, scholars assert that people tend to stick to established routines or solutions as long as they are not forced to deviate from them by constraints. 182  183  184  In this sense, Neren posits that scarcity is an important driver of creativity. 185  Consistently, Gibbert and Scranton demonstrated how material constraints facilitated the development of jet engines in World War II . 186  To reconcile these competing views, contingency models were proposed. 187  188  189  The rationale behind these models is that certain contingency factors e.g., creativity climate or creativity relevant skills influence the relationship between constraints and creativity. 187  These contingency factors reflect the need for higher levels of motivation and skills when working on creative tasks under constraints. 187  Depending on these contingency factors, there is either a positive or negative relationship between constraints and creativity. 187  188  Economic views  edit  Economic approaches to creativity have focussed on three aspects  the impact of creativity on economic growth, methods of modelling markets for creativity, and the maximisation of economic creativity innovation. In the early 20th century, Joseph Schumpeter introduced the economic theory of creative destruction , to describe the way in which old ways of doing things are endogenously destroyed and replaced by the new. Some economists such as Paul Romer  view creativity as an important element in the recombination of elements to produce new technologies and products and, consequently, economic growth. Creativity leads to capital , and creative products are protected by intellectual property laws. Mark A. Runco and Daniel Rubenson have tried to describe a  psychoeconomic  model of creativity. 190  In such a model, creativity is the product of endowments and active investments in creativity the costs and benefits of bringing creative activity to market determine the supply of creativity. Such an approach has been criticised for its view of creativity consumption as always having positive utility , and for the way it analyses the value of future innovations. 191  The creative class is seen by some to be an important driver of modern economies. In his 2002 book, The Rise of the Creative Class , economist Richard Florida popularized the notion that regions with 3 Ts of economic development Technology, Talent and Tolerance also have high concentrations of creative professionals and tend to have a higher level of economic development. Fostering creativity  edit  Main article Creativity techniques Several different researchers have proposed methods of increasing the creativity of an individual. Such ideas range from the psychological -cognitive, such as Osborn - Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process , Synectics , science-based creative thinking, Purdue Creative Thinking Program, and Edward de Bono s lateral thinking  to the highly structured, such as TRIZ the Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving and its variant Algorithm of Inventive Problem Solving developed by the Russian scientist Genrich Altshuller , and Computer-Aided morphological analysis . Daniel Pink, in his 2005 book A Whole New Mind , repeating arguments posed throughout the 20th century, argues that we are entering a new age where creativity is becoming increasingly important. In this conceptual age , we will need to foster and encourage right-directed thinking representing creativity and emotion over left-directed thinking representing logical, analytical thought. However, this simplification of right versus left brain thinking is not supported by the research data. 192  Nickerson 193  provides a summary of the various creativity techniques that have been proposed. These include approaches that have been developed by both academia and industry Establishing purpose and intention Building basic skills Encouraging acquisitions of domain-specific knowledge Stimulating and rewarding curiosity and exploration Building motivation, especially internal motivation Encouraging confidence and a willingness to take risks Focusing on mastery and self-competition Promoting supportable beliefs about creativity Providing opportunities for choice and discovery Developing self-management metacognitive skills Teaching techniques and strategies for facilitating creative performance Providing balance Managing the need for closure  edit  Experiments suggest the need for closure of task participants, whether as a reflection of personality or induced through time pressure, negatively impacts creativity. 194  Accordingly, it has been suggested that reading fiction, which can reduce the cognitive need for closure, may help to encourage creativity. 195  Education policies  edit  Some see the conventional system of schooling as stifling of creativity and attempt particularly in the preschool  kindergarten and early school years to provide a creativity-friendly, rich, imagination-fostering environment for young children. 193  196  197  Researchers have seen this as important because technology is advancing our society at an unprecedented rate and creative problem solving will be needed to cope with these challenges as they arise. 197  In addition to helping with problem solving, creativity also helps students identify problems where others have failed to do so. 193  196  198  See the Waldorf School as an example of an education program that promotes creative thought. Promoting intrinsic motivation and problem solving are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative when they see a task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. 196  197  199  200  To promote creative thinking, educators need to identify what motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks. 193  201  Teaching students to solve problems that do not have well defined answers is another way to foster their creativity. This is accomplished by allowing students to explore problems and redefine them, possibly drawing on knowledge that at first may seem unrelated to the problem in order to solve it. 193  196  197  199  In adults, mentoring individuals is another way to foster their creativiy. 202  However, the benefits of mentoring creativity apply only to creative contributions considered great in a given field, not to everyday creative expression . 69  Scotland  edit  In the Scottish education system , creativity is identified as a core skillset for learning, life and work and is defined as a process which generates ideas that have value to the individual. It involves looking at familiar things with a fresh eye, examining problems with an open mind, making connections, learning from mistakes and using imagination to explore new possibilities. 1 The need to develop a shared language and understanding of creativity and its role across every aspect of learning, teaching and continuous improvement was identified as a necessary aim 2 and a set of four skills is used to allow educators to discuss and develop creativity skills across all subjects and sectors of education  curiosity, openmindedness, imagination and problem solving. 3 Distinctions are made between creative learning when learners are using their creativity skills, creative teaching when educators are using their creativity skills and creative change when creativity skills are applied to planning and improvement. 4 Scotlands national Creative Learning Plan 5 supports the development of creativity skills in all learners and of educators expertise in developing creativity skills. A range of resources have been created to support and assess this 6 including a national review of creativity across learning by Her Majestys Inspectorate for Education. 7 Academic journals  edit  Creativity Research Journal International Journal of Creative Computing Journal of Creative Behavior Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts Thinking Skills and Creativity See also  edit  Adaptive performance Brainstorming Computational creativity Confabulation neural networks E-scape Genius Guided visualization Heroic theory of invention and scientific development History of the concept of creativity Innovation Invention such as artistic invention in the visual arts  Lateral thinking Learned industriousness Malevolent creativity Multiple discovery Music therapy Musical improvisation Why Man Creates film Notes  edit   a b c d e Runco, Mark A.
