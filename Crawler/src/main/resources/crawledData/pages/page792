The Cyrillic script   s   r  l  k   is a writing system used for various alphabets across Eurasia and is used as the national script in various Slavic -, Turkic - and Persian -speaking countries in Eastern Europe , the Caucasus , Central Asia , and North Asia . In the 9th century AD the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I the Great , following the cultural and political course of his father Boris I , commissioned a new Bulgarian script, the Early Cyrillic alphabet , to be made at the Preslav Literary School in the First Bulgarian Empire which would replace the Glagolitic script , produced earlier by Saints Cyril and Methodius and the same disciples that created the new Slavic script in Bulgaria . The usage of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria was made official in 893. 3  4  5  The new script became the basis of alphabets used in various languages, especially those of Orthodox Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. As of 2019 update  , around 250 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages, with Russia accounting for about half of them. 6  With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, Cyrillic became the third official script of the European Union , following Latin and Greek . 7  Cyrillic is derived from the Greek uncial script , augmented by letters from the older Glagolitic alphabet , including some ligatures . These additional letters were used for Old Church Slavonic sounds not found in Greek. The script is named in honor of the two Byzantine brothers, 8  Saints Cyril and Methodius , who created the Glagolitic alphabet earlier on. Modern scholars believe that Cyrillic was developed and formalized by early disciples of Cyril and Methodius. In the early 18th century, the Cyrillic script used in Russia was heavily reformed by Peter the Great , who had recently returned from his Grand Embassy in western Europe . The new letterforms became closer to those of the Latin alphabet several archaic letters were removed and several letters were personally designed by Peter the Great such as , which was inspired by the Latin R. West European typography culture was also adopted. 9  Contents 1 Letters 2 Letterforms and typography 3 Cyrillic alphabets 4 Name 5 History 6 Relationship to other writing systems 6.1 Latin script 6.2 Romanization 6.3 Cyrillization 7 Computer encoding 7.1 Unicode 7.2 Other 7.3 Keyboard layouts 8 See also 9 Notes 10 References 11 External links Letters  edit  Cyrillic script spread throughout the East Slavic and some South Slavic territories, being adopted for writing local languages, such as Old East Slavic .

Sometimes different letters were used interchangeably, for example      , as were typographical variants like    . There were also commonly used ligatures like    .

Many of the letterforms differed from those of modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in manuscripts , and changed over time. Few fonts include glyphs sufficient to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with Unicode policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or ligatures found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character. The Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern Church Slavonic language. In Microsoft Windows, the Segoe UI user interface font is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.  citation needed  Slavic Cyrillic letters  A  Be  Ve  Ge  Ghe upturn  De  Dje  Gje  Ye  Yo  Ukrainian Ye  Zhe  Ze  Zje  Dze  I  Dotted I  Yi  Short I  Je  Ka  El  Lje  Em  En  Nje  O  Pe  Er  Es  Sje  Te  Tshe  Kje  U  Short U  Ef  Kha  Tse  Che  Dzhe  Sha  Shcha  Hard  sign Yer  Yery  Soft  sign Yeri  E  Yu  Ya Examples of non-Slavic Cyrillic letters see List of Cyrillic letters for more  A with breve  Schwa  Ae  Ghayn  Ge with middle hook  Ghayn with hook  Ge with descender  Zhe with breve  Zhe with diaeresis  Abkhazian Dze  Bashkir Qa  Ka with stroke  En with tail  En with descender  En with hook  En-ghe  Oe  O-hook  Er with tick  The  U with tilde  U with macron  U with diaeresis  U with double acute  Ue  Kha with descender  Kha with hook  Kha with stroke  Shha He  Te Tse  Che with descender  Khakassian Che  Che with vertical stroke  Abkhazian Che  Semisoft sign  Palochka Cyrillic letters used in the past  A  iotified  E  iotified  Yus  small  Yus  big  Yus  small iotified  Yus  big iotified  Ksi  Psi  Yn  Fita  Izhitsa  Izhitsa okovy  Koppa  Uk  Omega  Ot  Yat Letterforms and typography  edit  The development of Cyrillic typography passed directly from the medieval stage to the late Baroque , without a Renaissance phase as in Western Europe . Late Medieval Cyrillic letters still found on many icon inscriptions today show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters. Peter the Great , Czar of Russia, mandated the use of westernized letter forms  ru  in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters such as the placement of serifs , the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles, modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type. Letters Ge, De, I, I kratkoye, Me, Te, Tse, Be and Ve in upright printed and cursive handwritten variants. Top is set in Georgia font, bottom in Odessa Script. Cyrillic uppercase and lowercase letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially small capitals with exceptions Cyrillic  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and   adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase   is typically designed under the influence of Latin p , lowercase  ,   and   are traditional handwritten forms, although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs. 16  Cyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have roman and italic types practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both. However, the native font terminology in most Slavic languages for example, in Russian does not use the words roman and italic in this sense. 17  Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns Cyrillic letters in cursive Roman type is called pryamoy shrift upright typecompare with Normalschrift regular type in German Italic type is called kursiv cursive or kursivniy shrift cursive typefrom the German word Kursive , meaning italic typefaces and not cursive writing Cursive handwriting is rukopisniy shrift handwritten type in Russianin German Kurrentschrift or Laufschrift , both meaning literally running type As in Latin typography, a sans-serif face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type  naklonniy shrift sloped, or slanted type instead of italic. Similarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters typically lowercase uppercase only for handwritten or stylish types are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts for example, italic Cyrillic    is the lowercase counterpart of    not of   . A boldfaced type is called poluzhirniy shrift semi-bold type, because there existed fully boldfaced shapes that have been out of use since the beginning of the 20th century. A bold italic combination bold slanted does not exist for all font families. In Standard Serbian, as well as in Macedonian, 18  some italic and cursive letters are allowed to be different to resemble more to the handwritten letters. The regular upright shapes are generally standardized among languages and there are no officially recognized variations. 19  The following table shows the differences between the upright and italic Cyrillic letters of the Russian alphabet . Italic forms significantly different from their upright analogues, or especially confusing to users of a Latin alphabet, are highlighted. Also available as a graphical image .                                                                   Note in some fonts or styles, lowercase italic Cyrillic       may look like Latin  g  and lowercase italic Cyrillic       may look exactly like a capital italic T    T , only smaller. Distribution of the Cyrillic script worldwide    Cyrillic is the sole official script.    Cyrillic is co-official with another alphabet. In the cases of Moldova and Georgia, this is in breakaway regions not recognized by the central government.    Cyrillic is not official, but is in common use as a legacy script.    Cyrillic is not widely used Cyrillic alphabets  edit  Main article Cyrillic alphabets Among others, Cyrillic is the standard script for writing the following languages Slavic languages  Belarusian , Bulgarian , Macedonian , Russian , Rusyn , Serbo-Croatian for Standard Serbian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin , Ukrainian Non-Slavic languages  Abkhaz , Aleut now mostly in church texts, Bashkir , Chuvash , Erzya , Kazakh to be replaced by Latin script by 2025 20  , Kildin Sami , Komi , Kyrgyz , Dungan , Mari , Moksha , Mongolian , Ossetic , Romani some dialects, SakhaYakut , Tajik , Tatar , Tlingit now only in church texts, Tuvan , Udmurt , Yuit Siberian Yupik, and Yupik in Alaska . The Cyrillic script has also been used for languages of Alaska, 21  Slavic Europe except for Western Slavic and some Southern Slavic , the Caucasus , Siberia , and the Russian Far East . The first alphabet derived from Cyrillic was Abur , used for the Komi language . Other Cyrillic alphabets include the Molodtsov alphabet for the Komi language and various alphabets for Caucasian languages . Name  edit  Cyrillic Script Monument in Antarctica Since the script was conceived and popularised by the followers of Cyril and Methodius , rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name denotes homage rather than authorship. The name Cyrillic often confuses people who are not familiar with the scripts history, because it does not identify a country of origin in contrast to the Greek alphabet. Among the general public, it is often called the Russian alphabet, because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably Stefan Tsanev , have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the Bulgarian alphabet instead, for the sake of historical accuracy. 22  In Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, and Serbian, the Cyrillic alphabet is also known as azbuka , derived from the old names of the first two letters of most Cyrillic alphabets just as the term alphabet came from the first two Greek letters alpha and beta .

It is derived from the Greek uncial script letters, augmented by ligatures and consonants from the older Glagolitic alphabet for sounds not found in Greek. Tradition holds that Cyrillic and Glagolitic were formalized either by Saints Cyril and Methodius who brought Christianity to the southern Slavs, or by their disciples. 24  25  26  27  Paul Cubberley posits that although Cyril may have codified and expanded Glagolitic, it was his students in the First Bulgarian Empire under Tsar Simeon the Great that developed Cyrillic from the Greek letters in the 890s as a more suitable script for church books. 23  Later Cyrillic spread among other Slavic peoples, as well as among non-Slavic Vlachs . Cyrillic and Glagolitic were used for the Church Slavonic language , especially the Old Church Slavonic variant. Hence expressions such as  is the tenth Cyrillic letter typically refer to the order of the Church Slavonic alphabet not every Cyrillic alphabet uses every letter available in the script. The Cyrillic script came to dominate Glagolitic in the 12th century. The literature produced in the Old Bulgarian language soon spread north and became the lingua franca of the Balkans and Eastern Europe, where it came to also be known as Old Church Slavonic . 28  29  30  31  32  The alphabet used for the modern Church Slavonic language in Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. A notable example of such linguistic reform can be attributed to Vuk Stefanovi Karadi who updated the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet by removing certain graphemes no longer represented in the vernacular, and introducing graphemes specific to Serbian i.e.      , distancing it from Church Slavonic alphabet in use prior to the reform. Today, many languages in the Balkans , Eastern Europe, and northern Eurasia are written in Cyrillic alphabets. Relationship to other writing systems  edit  Latin script  edit  A number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a Latin alphabet , such as Azerbaijani , Uzbek , Serbian and Romanian in the Republic of Moldova until 1989, in Romania throughout the 19th century. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova except the breakaway region of Transnistria , where Moldovan Cyrillic is official, Turkmenistan , and Azerbaijan . Uzbekistan still uses both systems, and Kazakhstan has officially begun a transition from Cyrillic to Latin scheduled to be complete by 2025. The Russian government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all federal subjects of Russia , to promote closer ties across the federation.  citation needed  This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages for others, such as Chechen and Ingush speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism. Map of European countries by script of national language.

Cyrillic is nominally the official script of Serbias administration according to the Serbian constitution 33  however, the law does not regulate scripts in standard language, or standard language itself by any means. In practice the scripts are equal, with Latin being used more often in a less official capacity. 34  The Zhuang alphabet , used between the 1950s and 1980s in portions of the Peoples Republic of China, used a mixture of Latin, phonetic, numeral-based, and Cyrillic letters. The non-Latin letters, including Cyrillic, were removed from the alphabet in 1982 and replaced with Latin letters that closely resembled the letters they replaced. Romanization  edit  There are various systems for Romanization of Cyrillic text, including transliteration to convey Cyrillic spelling in Latin letters, and transcription to convey pronunciation . Standard Cyrillic-to-Latin transliteration systems include Scientific transliteration , used in linguistics, is based on the Bosnian and Croatian Latin alphabet .
