Add a diagram or photo  Complex text might be illustrated by a diagram. Wikimedia Commons also has over 12 million images, which can be searched such as for galaxy. Even if the image or diagram is not exact, mention extra details in the caption-area, or use TemplateSuperimpose or TemplateLocation map to overlay a custom labelsymbol onto an image. Add a wikitable or list  Multi-column wikitables could clarify groups of data however, simple lists with colon-asterisk  bullets might be enough. See spark plug , with a list of risksbenefits. Make it clear whats happening and to what A common example is a vague pronoun reference Emily was friends with Francine until she changed her job vague Who changed jobs Pronoun she equally applies to both. Also referring back to a list but not specifying the entry. Use specific wording rather than vague whenever possible For example, instead of saying, in the old days, specify the time period you are referring to say, the 19th century, or the 1960s. Similarly, do not reference now  the word Recently or Soon or their synonyms will become meaningless quickly. Use As of or a specific date. Make sure youre using the right words  In one of the great critiques of a fellow author, Mark Twain listed eighteen rules of writing romantic fiction violated by James Fenimore Cooper . 1  Besides the criticism of Coopers characterisation and plot, Twain also said that a writer should Avoid slovenliness of form Employ a simple and straightforward style Eschew surplusage see KISS principle  Not omit necessary details Say what he is proposing to say, not merely come near it. Avoid euphemisms  we dont have to bowdlerize  Use good grammars Use the right word, not its second cousin Check your intent  Wikipedia is a place to inform and to educate. It is not a technical journal. Information from technical journals might need to be reduced to short sentences four prepositions, because some journals encourage writing multi-level sentences spanning fifteen lines, with sub-sub-clauses. Check your spelling  Usually misspelled words are obvious in their intent e.g., Qualty is obviously Quality, however Tedting could be Testing or Texting or editing. If it is not actually misspelled, or it is intended to be so, use the   Sic   template. Make use of headings  A huge block of text can be daunting, but dividing it into sections, and subsections, can organize a logical structure onto the text, separating statements into each grouped section. Specific clarification There are some common situations where use of a more specific clarification template might make the desired clarification clearer. A common case is an article citing a scientific measurement without indicating how the measurement was taken. For example, the following statement about solar intensity at the earths surface without specifying the suns elevation could be annotated with the following tag The following tag links to a Wikipedia project to clear bias based on the source of the information The suns intensity is 90 watts per square meter.  where  See also   Distinguish   Related inline templates   Ambiguous     Clarify     Clarify span     Definition     Explain     Non sequitur     Technical statement     Vague   Message-box templates   Confusing     Confusing section     Context     Technical   Related pages WikipediaCiting sources WikipediaExpert help WikipediaExplain jargon WikipediaTemplate messagesCleanup for an overview of clean-up templates of various formats References  Fenimore Coopers Literary Offences by Mark Twain v t e Inline cleanup tags Attribution   According to whom     Attribution needed     By whom     From whom     Like whom     To whom     Who     With whom   Clarity   Ambiguous     Clarify     Clarify span     Clarify timeframe     Context inline     Expand acronym     Incomprehensible inline     Non sequitur     Which calendar   Precision   By how much     Definition     Definition needed     Example needed     Explain     How     How often     Quantify     Specify     Vague     When     Where     Which     Who else     Why     Year needed   Excessive   Duplication span     Importance inline     Relevance inline     Undue weight inline   Miscellaneous   Chinese script needed inline     Copyright violation     Copyvio link     Disambiguation needed     Needs IPA     Original research inline     Pronunciation needed     Siadn     Synthesis inline     Synthesis inline span     Verify spelling     Whose translation   Neutrality   Buzzword inline     Editorializing     Lopsided     Peacock term     POV statement     Weasel inline     Weasel word some span   Time-sensitivity   Anachronism inline     Clarify timeframe     Is this date calibrated     Update after     Update inline     Update inline span   Verifiability Dubious   Contradict-inline     Disputed inline     Dubious     Dubious span     Inconsistent   Missing or problematic reference   Additional citation needed     Better source     Better source example     Check quotation     Chronology citation needed     Citation needed     Citation needed lead     Citation needed span     Citation not found     COI source     Deprecated inline     Excessive citations inline     Failed verification     Failed verification span     Irrelevant citation     Medical citation needed     Medical citation needed span     Nonspecific     Obsolete source     Primary source inline     Promotional source     Quote without source     Request quotation     Retracted     Scientific citation needed     Self-published inline     Tertiary source inline     Third-party inline     Unreliable fringe source     Unreliable medical source     Unreliable source     Verify quote     Verify source   Incomplete or broken citation   Author incomplete     Author missing     Bare URL inline     Date missing     Dead link     Edition needed     Episode needed     Full citation needed     Incomplete short citation     ISBN missing     Page needed     Place missing     Publisher missing     Season needed     Time needed     Title incomplete     Title missing     Volume needed     Year missing   Wording   Awkward     Buzzword inline     Copy edit inline     Technical statement   General advice Citing sources Reliable sources Maintenance template removal Citation needed Find sources Combining sources Referencing styles Inline cleanup templates   WikiProject Inline Templates Retrieved from  httpsen.wikipedia.orgwindex.phptitleWikipediaPlease_clarify oldid908463681  Categories  Wikipedia information pages Wikipedia how-to Hidden categories Wikipedia semi-protected project pages Wikipedia move-protected project pages Project pages with short description
