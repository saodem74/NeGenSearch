Michael Blumenthal became CEO and Chairman after the merger and resigned in 1990 after several years of losses. James Unruh formerly of Memorex and Honeywell became the new CEO and Chairman after Blumenthals departure and continued in that role until 1997, when Larry Weinbach of Arthur Andersen became the new CEO. By 1997, layoffs had reduced world-wide employee count to approximately 30,000. 6  In addition to hardware, both Burroughs and Sperry had a history of working on U.S. government contracts. Unisys continues to provide hardware, software, and services to various government agencies. 7  Soon after the merger, the market for proprietary mainframe-class systemsthe mainstream product of Unisys and its competitors such as IBM began a long-term decline that continues, at a lesser rate, today. In response, Unisys made the strategic decision to shift into high-end servers e.g., 32 processor Windows Servers, as well as information technology IT services such as systems integration, outsourcing, and related technical services, while holding onto the profitable revenue stream from maintaining its in stalled base of proprietary mainframe hardware and applications. 8  .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerdisplayflexflex-directioncolumn.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowdisplayflexflex-directionrowclearleftflex-wrapwrapwidth100box-sizingborder-box.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglemargin1pxfloatleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theaderclearbothfont-weightboldtext-aligncenteralign-selfcenterbackground-colortransparent width100.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-alignleftbackground-colortransparent.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-lefttext-alignleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-righttext-alignright.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-centertext-aligncentermedia all and max-width720px.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerwidth100importantbox-sizi ngborder-boxmax-widthnoneimportantalign-itemscenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowjustify-contentcenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglefloatnoneimportantmax-width100importantbox-sizingborder-boxtext-aligncenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-aligncenter Unisys Facilities Salt Lake City, USA Sydney, Australia Bangalore, India Fox Milne, Milton Keynes , UK Sao Paulo, Brazil Irvine, California, USA Toronto, Ontario , Canada Important events in the companys history include the development of the 2200 series in 1986, including the UNISYS 2200500 CMOS mainframe, and the Micro A in 1989, the first 9  desktop mainframe, the UNISYS ES7000 servers in 2000, and the Unisys blueprinting method of visualizing business rules and workflow in 2004. 10  In 1988 the company acquired Convergent Technologies , makers of CTOS . 11  Joseph McGrath served as CEO and President from January 2005, until September, 2008.

Controversies  edit  In 1987, Unisys was sued with Rockwell Shuttle Operations Company for 5.2 million by two former employees of the Unisys Corporation, one a subcontractor responsible for the computer programs for the space shuttle. 57  The suit filed by Sylvia Robins, a former Unisys engineer, and Ria Solomon, who worked for Robins, charges that the two were forced from their jobs and harassed after complaining about safety violations and inflated costs. Unisys overcharged the U.S. government and in 1998 was found guilty of failure to supply adequate equipment. 58  In 1998, Unisys Corporation agreed to pay the government 2.25 million to settle allegations that it supplied refurbished, rather than new, computer materials to several federal agencies in violation of the terms of its contract. Unisys admitted to supplying re-worked or refurbished computer components to various civilian and military agencies in the early 1990s, when the contract required the company to provide new equipment. The market price for the refurbished material was less than the price for new material which the government paid. In 1998, Unisys was found guilty of price inflation and Government Contract Fraud with the company settling to avoid further prosecution. 59  Lockheed Martin and Unisys paid the government 3.15 million to settle allegations that Unisys inflated the prices of spare parts sold to the U.S. Department of Commerce for its NEXRAD Doppler Radar System, in violation of the False Claims Act , 31 U.S.C.  3729, et seq. The settlement resolves allegations that Unisys knew that prices it paid Concurrent Computer Corporation for the spare parts were inflated when it passed on those prices to the government. Unisys had obtained price discounts from Concurrent on other items Unisys was purchasing from Concurrent at Unisys own expense in exchange for agreeing to pay Concurrent the inflated prices. 60  Prior to 1993 Unisys paid Senator DAmatos brother, Armand P. DAmato for access to the senator. Armand P. DAmato was convicted for mail fraud in connection with 120,500 he received from Unisys to lobby the Senator. Unisys attracted attention in 1994 after announcing its patent on the LZW data compression algorithm, which is used in the common GIF image file format. For a more complete discussion of this issue, see Graphics Interchange FormatUnisys and LZW patent enforcement . 61  All global patents that Unisys held relating to the standard GIF format expired as of 7 July 2004, so the Unisys LZW patent issue is no longer an encumbrance to GIF. Unisys was the target of  Operation Ill Wind , a major corruption investigation in the mid-to-late 1980s. As part of the settlement, all Unisys employees were required to receive ethics training each year, a practice that continues today. 62  In 2003 and 2004, Unisys retained the influential lobbyist Jack Abramoff , paying his firm 640,000 for his services in those two years. In January 2006, Abramoff pleaded guilty to five felony counts for various crimes related to his federal lobbying activities, though none of his crimes involved work on behalf of Unisys. 63  The lobbying activities of Abramoff and his associates were the subject of a large federal investigation. In October 2005, the Washington Post reported that the company had allegedly overbilled on the 1-to-3-billion Transportation Security Administration contract for almost 171,000 hours of labor and overtime at up to the maximum rate of 131.13 per hour, including 24,983 hours not allowed by the contract. Unisys denied wrongdoing. 64  In 2006, the Washington Post reported that the FBI was investigating Unisys for alleged cybersecurity lapses under the companys contract with the United States Department of Homeland Security . A number of security lapses supposedly occurred during the contract, including incidents in which data was transmitted to Chinese servers. 65  Unisys denies all charges and said it has documentation disproving the allegations. 66  In 2007, Unisys was found guilty of Misrepresentation of Retiree Benefits. 67  A federal judge in Pennsylvania ordered Unisys Corp. to reinstate within 60 days free lifetime retiree medical benefits to 12 former employees who were employed by a Unisys predecessor, the Burroughs Corporation. The judge ruled that Unisys misrepresented the cost and duration of retiree medical benefits at a time trial plaintiffs were making retirement decisions and while it was advising them about the benefits the company would provide during retirement. Also in 2007, Unisys was found guilty of wilful trademark infringement in Visible Systems v. Unisys Trademark Infringement. 68  Computer company Visible Systems prevailed over Unisys Corp. in a trademark infringement lawsuit filed in Massachusetts federal court. In November 2007, the court entered an injunction and final judgment ordering Unisys to discontinue its use of the Visible trademark, upholding the jurys award to Visible Systems of 250,000 in damages, and awarding an additional 17,555 in interest. Visible Systems claimed Unisys wrongfully used the name Visible in marketing its software and services. The jury found the infringement by Unisys was willful. Visible Systems appealed the final judgment, believing the court wrongly excluded the issues of bad faith and disgorgement of an estimated 17 billion in unjust profits from the consideration of the jury. In 2008, Joe McGrath stepped down after a no confidence vote from the board, and was replaced by J. Edward Coleman, former CEO of Gateway Incorporated. The president of the federal sector, Greg Baroni, was also fired . 69  Unisys announced on June 30, 2008, that the Transportation Security Administration TSA had not selected the company for Phase 2 of procurement for the Information Technology Infrastructure Program. 70  In July, Unisys announced its plans to file a formal protest of the TSA decision with the Government Accountability Office GAO. 71  On August 20, 2008, the TSA announced it was allowing bidding from all competitors including Unisys and Northrop Grumman, who both filed formal protests with the GAO and protested TSAs decision to the Federal Aviation Administration s Office of Dispute Resolution, after not initially being selected. 72  In 2010, Unisys jettisoned its Medicare processing Health Information Management service to Molina Healthcare for 135 million. 73  Also in 2010, Unisys Hungary terminated the local Workers Union representative Gabor Pinters employment contract with immediate effect for raising concerns on the companys practice about the overtime payments and the non-respect of the health regulations in its local Shared Services Center . According to the verdict of the Labour Court of Budapest , Unisys act was illegal and the Company must reimburse all damages of the Workers Union representative. 74  75  In 2012, Unisys Netherlands censured computer security expert Chris Kubecka for an anti-censorship talk at the Hackers_on_Planet_Earth Number Nine. A conference which focused on highlighting censorship with a talk titled The Internet is for Porn. Unisys responded to the news story by quoting a non-existent policy. 76  See also  edit  Burroughs Corporation CANDE Convergent Technologies Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation Elliott ALGOL ES7000 USAS application HOLMES2 Internet Censorship J.
