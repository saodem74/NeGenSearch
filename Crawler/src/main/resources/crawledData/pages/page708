ALCOR From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For the cryonics organization, see Alcor Life Extension Foundation . ALCOR is a radar tracking station in Roi-Namur island in the north part of the Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands. ALCOR is an early computer language definition created by the ALCOR Group , a consortium of universities, research institutions and manufacturers in Europe and the United States which was founded in 1959 and which had 60 members in 1966. The group had the aim of a common compiler specification for a subset of ALGOL 60 after the ALGOL meeting in Copenhagen in 1958. ALCOR is an acronym, from AL GOL Co nverte r . In addition, the naming of Alcor is an astronomical reference. Algol is named, in addition to its programming application, for the star Algol  In this way, Alcor is also named in astronomical reference for the star Alcor . The fact that this star is the fainter companion of the 2nd magnitude star Zeta Ursae Majoris was sometimes ironized as being a bad omen for the future of the language. In Europe, a high level machine architecture for ALGOL 60 was devised which was emulated on various real computers, among them the Siemens 2002 and the IBM 7090 . An ALGOL manual was published which provided a detailed introduction of all features of the language with many program snippets, and four appendixes This article contains Unicode 6.0  Miscellaneous Technical  characters.
