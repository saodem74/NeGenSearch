It is white in solid state and it is miscible with water. 2  While in liquid state dissolved state it is a colorless solution. Production includes both artificial synthesis as well as natural sources. Lactic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid AHA due to the presence of carboxyl group adjacent to the hydroxyl group. It is used as a synthetic intermediate in many organic synthesis industries and in various biochemical industries. The conjugate base of lactic acid is called lactate . In solution, it can ionize a proton from the carboxyl group, producing the lactate ion CH 3 CHOHCO  2 . Compared to acetic acid , its p K a is 1 unit less, meaning lactic acid is ten times more acidic than acetic acid. This higher acidity is the consequence of the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the -hydroxyl and the carboxylate group. Lactic acid is chiral , consisting of two enantiomers . One is known as L --lactic acid or  S -lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D --lactic acid or  R -lactic acid. A mixture of the two in equal amounts is called DL -lactic acid, or racemic lactic acid. Lactic acid is hygroscopic . DL -lactic acid is miscible with water and with ethanol above its melting point, which is around 17 or 18  C. D -lactic acid and L -lactic acid have a higher melting point. Lactic acid produced by fermentation of milk is often racemic, although certain species of bacteria produce solely R-lactic acid. On the other hand, lactic acid produced by anaerobic respiration in animal muscles has the S configuration and is sometimes called sarcolactic acid, from the Greek sarx for flesh. In animals, L -lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase LDH in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise . It does not increase in concentration until the rate of lactate production exceeds the rate of lactate removal, which is governed by a number of factors, including monocarboxylate transporters , concentration and isoform of LDH, and oxidative capacity of tissues. The concentration of blood lactate is usually 12   mM at rest, but can rise to over 20  mM during intense exertion and as high as 25  mM afterward. 6  7  In addition to other biological roles, L -lactic acid is the primary endogenous agonist of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor  1 HCA 1 , which is a G io -coupled G protein-coupled receptor GPCR. 8  9  In industry, lactic acid fermentation is performed by lactic acid bacteria , which convert simple carbohydrates such as glucose , sucrose , or galactose to lactic acid. These bacteria can also grow in the mouth  the acid they produce is responsible for the tooth decay known as caries . 10  11  12  13  In medicine , lactate is one of the main components of lactated Ringers solution and Hartmanns solution . These intravenous fluids consist of sodium and potassium cations along with lactate and chloride anions in solution with distilled water , generally in concentrations isotonic with human blood . It is most commonly used for fluid resuscitation after blood loss due to trauma , surgery , or burns .

The name reflects the lact- combining form derived from the Latin word lac , which means milk. In 1808, Jns Jacob Berzelius discovered that lactic acid actually L -lactate also is produced in muscles during exertion. 14  Its structure was established by Johannes Wislicenus in 1873. In 1856, the role of Lactobacillus in the synthesis of lactic acid was discovered by Louis Pasteur . And hence this pathway was used for the commercial by the German pharmacy Boehringer Ingelheim in 1895. In 2006, global production of lactic acid reached 275,000 metric tons with an average annual growth of 10. 15  Production  edit  Lactic acid is produced industrially by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates , or by chemical synthesis from acetaldehyde that comes from coal or crude oil. 16  In 2009, lactic acid was produced predominantly 7090 17  by fermentation. Production of racemic lactic acid consisting of a 11 mixture of D and L stereoisomers, or of mixtures with up to 99.9 L -lactic acid, is possible by microbial fermentation. Industrial scale production of D -lactic acid by fermentation is possible, but much more challenging. Fermentative production Fermented milk products are obtained industrially by fermentation of milk or whey by Lactobacillius species bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus , Lactobacillus casei , Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus  Lactobacillus bulgaricus , Lactobacillus helveticus , Lactococcus lactis , and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus  Streptococcus thermophilus . As a starting material for industrial production of lactic acid, almost any carbohydrate source containing C5 C6 sugars can be used. Pure sucrose, glucose from starch, raw sugar, and beet juice are frequently used. 18  Lactic acid producing bacteria can be divided in two classes homofermentative bacteria like Lactobacillus casei and Lactococcus lactis , producing two moles of lactate from one mole of glucose, and heterofermentative species producing one mole of lactate from one mole of glucose as well as carbon dioxide and acetic acid  ethanol . 19  Chemical production Racemic lactic acid is produced by the addition of hydrogen cyanide to acetaldehyde and subsequent hydrolysis, forming lactonitrile . When hydrolysis performed by hydrochloric acid , ammonium chloride forms as a by-product the Japanese company Musashino is one of the last big manufactures of lactic acid by this route. 20  Synthesis of both racemic and enantiopure lactic acids is also possible from other starting materials  vinyl acetate , glycerol , etc. by application of catalytic procedures. 21  Biology  edit  Molecular biology  edit  L -lactic acid is the primary endogenous agonist of hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor  1 HCA 1 , a G io -coupled G protein-coupled receptor GPCR. 8  9  Exercise and lactate  edit  During power exercises such as sprinting , when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate , and lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise. The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD  regeneration pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD  , which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD  quickly enough. The resulting lactate can be used in two ways Oxidation back to pyruvate by well-oxygenated muscle cells, heart cells, and brain cells Pyruvate is then directly used to fuel the Krebs cycle Conversion to glucose via gluconeogenesis in the liver and release back into circulation see Cori cycle 22  If blood glucose concentrations are high, the glucose can be used to build up the livers glycogen stores. However, lactate is continually formed even at rest and during moderate exercise. Some causes of this are metabolism in red blood cells that lack mitochondria , and limitations resulting from the enzyme activity that occurs in muscle fibers having high glycolytic capacity. 22  In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a construct or myth, pointing out that part of the H  comes from ATP hydrolysis ATP 4  H 2 O  ADP 3  HPO 2 4  H  , and that reducing pyruvate to lactate pyruvate   NADH  H   lactate   NAD   actually consumes H  . 23  Lindinger et al . 24  countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in H  . After all, the production of lactate  from a neutral molecule must increase H   to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergss paper, however, was that lactate  is produced from pyruvate  , which has the same charge. It is pyruvate  production from neutral glucose that generates H         C 6 H 12 O 6  2  NAD   2  ADP 3  2   HPO 2 4  2   CH 3 COCO  2  2  H   2  NADH  2  ATP 4  2  H 2 O Subsequent lactate  production absorbs these protons 2   CH 3 COCO  2  2  H   2  NADH  2   CH 3 CHOHCO  2  2  NAD  Overall C 6 H 12 O 6  2  NAD   2  ADP 3  2   HPO 2 4  2   CH 3 COCO  2  2  H   2  NADH  2  ATP 4  2  H 2 O  2   CH 3 CHOHCO  2  2  NAD   2  ATP 4  2  H 2 O Although the reaction glucose  2  lactate   2  H  releases two H  when viewed on its own, the H  are absorbed in the production of ATP. On the other hand, the absorbed acidity is released during subsequent hydrolysis of ATP ATP 4  H 2 O  ADP 3  HPO 2 4  H  . So once the use of ATP is included, the overall reaction is C 6 H 12 O 6  2   CH 3 COCO  2  2  H  The generation of CO 2 during respiration also causes an increase in H  . Brain metabolism  edit  Although glucose is usually assumed to be the main energy source for living tissues, there are some indications that it is lactate, and not glucose, that is preferentially metabolized by neurons in the brain of several mammalian species the notable ones being mice , rats , and humans . 25  26  According to the lactate-shuttle hypothesis , glial cells are responsible for transforming glucose into lactate, and for providing lactate to the neurons. 27  28  Because of this local metabolic activity of glial cells, the extracellular fluid immediately surrounding neurons strongly differs in composition from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid , being much richer with lactate, as was found in microdialysis studies. 25  Some evidence suggests that lactate is important at early stages of development for brain metabolism in prenatal and early postnatal subjects, with lactate at these stages having higher concentrations in body liquids, and being utilized by the brain preferentially over glucose. 25  It was also hypothesized that lactate may exert a strong action over GABAergic networks in the developing brain , making them more inhibitory than it was previously assumed, 29  acting either through better support of metabolites, 25  or alterations in base intracellular pH levels, 30  31  or both. 32  Studies of brain slices of mice show that beta -hydroxybutyrate , lactate, and pyruvate act as oxidative energy substrates, causing an increase in the NADPH oxidation phase, that glucose was insufficient as an energy carrier during intense synaptic activity and, finally, that lactate can be an efficient energy substrate capable of sustaining and enhancing brain aerobic energy metabolism in vitro . 33  The study, provides novel data on biphasic NADPH fluorescence transients, an important physiological response to neural activation that has been reproduced in many studies and that is believed to originate predominately from activity-induced concentration changes to the cellular NADH pools. 34  Blood testing  edit  Reference ranges for blood tests , comparing lactate content shown in violet at center-right to other constituents in human blood Blood tests for lactate are performed to determine the status of the acid base homeostasis in the body. Blood sampling for this purpose is often by arterial blood sampling even if it is more difficult than venipuncture , because lactate differs substantially between arterial and venous levels, and the arterial level is more representative for this purpose. Reference ranges Lower limit Upper limit Unit Venous 4.5 35  19.8 35  mgdL 0.5 36  2.2 36  mmolL Arterial 4.5 35  14.4 35  mgdL 0.5 36  1.6 36  mmolL During childbirth , lactate levels in the fetus can be quantified by fetal scalp blood testing . Polymer precursor  edit  Main article polylactic acid Two molecules of lactic acid can be dehydrated to the lactone lactide . In the presence of catalysts lactide polymerize to either atactic or syndiotactic polylactide PLA, which are biodegradable polyesters . PLA is an example of a plastic that is not derived from petrochemicals . Pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications  edit  Lactic acid is also employed in pharmaceutical technology to produce water-soluble lactates from otherwise-insoluble active ingredients. It finds further use in topical preparations and cosmetics to adjust acidity and for its disinfectant and keratolytic properties. Foods  edit  Lactic acid is found primarily in sour milk products, such as koumiss , laban , yogurt , kefir , and some cottage cheeses . The casein in fermented milk is coagulated curdled by lactic acid. Lactic acid is also responsible for the sour flavor of sourdough bread. In lists of nutritional information lactic acid might be included under the term carbohydrate or carbohydrate by difference because this often includes everything other than water, protein, fat, ash, and ethanol. 37  If this is the case then the calculated food energy may use the standard 4 kilocalories 17  kJ per gram that is often used for all carbohydrates. But in some cases lactic acid is ignored in the calculation. 38  The energy density of lactic acid is 362 kilocalories 1,510  kJ per 100 g. 39  Some beers  sour beer  purposely contain lactic acid, one such being Belgian Lambics . Most commonly, this is produced naturally by various strains of bacteria. These bacteria ferment sugars into acids, unlike the yeast that ferment sugar into ethanol. After cooling the wort , yeast and bacteria are allowed to fall into the open fermenters. Brewers of more common beer styles would ensure that no such bacteria are allowed to enter the fermenter. Other sour styles of beer include Berliner weisse , Flanders red and American wild ale . 40  41  In winemaking, a bacterial process, natural or controlled, is often used to convert the naturally present malic acid to lactic acid, to reduce the sharpness and for other flavor-related reasons. This malolactic fermentation is undertaken by lactic acid bacteria . While not normally found in significant quantities in fruit, lactic acid is the primary organic acid in akebia fruit, making up 2.12 of the juice. 42  As a food additive it is approved for use in the EU, 43  USA 44  and Australia and New Zealand 45  it is listed by its INS number 270 or as E number E270. Lactic acid is used as a food preservative, curing agent, and flavoring agent. 46  It is an ingredient in processed foods and is used as a decontaminant during meat processing. 47  Lactic acid is produced commercially by fermentation of carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or lactose, or by chemical synthesis. 46  Carbohydrate sources include corn, beets, and cane sugar. 48  Forgery  edit  Lactic acid has historically been used to assist with the erasure of inks from official papers to be modified during forgery . 49  See also  edit  Hydroxybutyric acid Acids in wine Alanine cycle Biodegradable plastic Dental caries MCT1 , a lactate transporter Thiolactic acid References  edit   a b CHAPTER P-6.
