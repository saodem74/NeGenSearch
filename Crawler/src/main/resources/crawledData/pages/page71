Metamodeling From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Meta model redirects here. For other uses, see Meta model disambiguation . Example of a Geologic map information meta-model, with four types of meta-objects, and their self-references. 1  A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of a model, and metamodeling is the process of generating such metamodels. Thus metamodeling or meta-modeling is the analysis, construction and development of the frames, rules, constraints, models and theories applicable and useful for modeling a predefined class of problems. As its name implies, this concept applies the notions of meta- and modeling in software engineering and systems engineering . Metamodels are of many types and have diverse applications. 2  Contents 1 Overview 2 Topics 2.1 Definition 2.2 Metadata modeling 2.3 Model transformations 2.4 Relationship to ontologies 2.5 Types of metamodels 2.6 Zoos of metamodels 2.7 Metamodeling software 3 See also 4 References 5 Further reading Overview  edit  A metamodel or surrogate model is a model of the model, i.e. a simplified model of an actual model of a circuit, system, or software like entity. 3  4  Metamodel can be a mathematical relation or algorithm representing input and output relations. A model is an abstraction of phenomena in the real world  a metamodel is yet another abstraction, highlighting properties of the model itself. A model conforms to its metamodel in the way that a computer program conforms to the grammar of the programming language in which it is written. Various types of metamodels include polynomial equations, neural network, Kriging , etc. Metamodeling is the construction of a collection of concepts things, terms, etc. within a certain domain. Metamodeling typically involves studying the output and input relationships and then fitting right metamodels to represent that behavior. Common uses for metamodels are As a schema for semantic data that needs to be exchanged or stored As a language that supports a particular method or process As a language to express additional semantics of existing information As a mechanism to create tools that work with a broad class of models at run time As a schema for modeling and automatically exploring sentences of a language with applications to automated test synthesis As an approximation of a higher-fidelity model for use when reducing computational cost is necessary Because of the meta character of metamodeling, both the praxis and theory of metamodels are of relevance to metascience , metaphilosophy , metatheories and systemics , and meta-consciousness. The concept can be useful in mathematics , and has practical applications in computer science and computer engineering  software engineering . The latter are the main focus of this article.

Definition  edit  In software engineering , the use of models is an alternative to more common code-based development techniques. A model always conforms to a unique metamodel. One of the currently most active branch of Model Driven Engineering is the approach named model-driven architecture proposed by OMG . This approach is based on the utilization of a language to write metamodels called the Meta Object Facility or MOF . Typical metamodels proposed by OMG are UML , SysML , SPEM or CWM. ISO has also published the standard metamodel ISOIEC 24744 . 6  All the languages presented below could be defined as MOF metamodels. Metadata modeling  edit  Metadata modeling is a type of metamodeling used in software engineering and systems engineering for the analysis and construction of models applicable and useful to some predefined class of problems. see also data modeling . Model transformations  edit  One important move in model-driven engineering is the systematic use of model transformation languages . The OMG has proposed a standard for this called QVT for QueriesViewsTransformations. QVT is based on the meta-object facility or MOF. Among many other model transformation languages MTLs, some examples of implementations of this standard are AndroMDA, VIATRA , Tefkat , MT , ManyDesigns Portofino . Relationship to ontologies  edit  Meta-models are closely related to ontologies . Both are often used to describe and analyze the relations between concepts 7  Ontologies express something meaningful within a specified universe or domain of discourse by utilizing a grammar for using vocabulary. The grammar specifies what it means to be a well-formed statement, assertion, query, etc. formal constraints on how terms in the ontologys controlled vocabulary can be used together. 8  Meta-modeling can be considered as an explicit description constructs and rules of how a domain-specific model is built. In particular, this comprises a formalized specification of the domain-specific notations. Typically, metamodels are  and always should follow - a strict rule set. 9  A valid metamodel is an ontology, but not all ontologies are modeled explicitly as metamodels. 8  Types of metamodels  edit  For software engineering, several types of models and their corresponding modeling activities can be distinguished Metadata modeling MetaData model Meta-process modeling MetaProcess model Executable meta-modeling combining both of the above and much more, as in the general purpose tool Kermeta  Model transformation language see below Polynomial metamodels 10  Neural network metamodels Kriging metamodels Piecewise polynomial spline metamodels Gradient-enhanced kriging GEK Zoos of metamodels  edit  A library of similar metamodels has been called a Zoo of metamodels. 11  There are several types of meta-model zoos. 12  Some are expressed in ECore. Others are written in MOF 1.4  XMI 1.2. The metamodels expressed in UML - XMI 1.2 may be uploaded in Poseidon for UML , a UML CASE tool. Metamodeling software  edit  Surrogate Modeling Toolbox SMT httpsgithub.comSMTorgsmt  is a Python package that contains a collection of surrogate modeling methods, sampling techniques, and benchmarking functions. This package provides a library of surrogate models that is simple to use and facilitates the implementation of additional methods. SMT is different from existing surrogate modeling libraries because of its emphasis on derivatives, including training derivatives used for gradient-enhanced modeling, prediction derivatives, and derivatives with respect to the training data. It also includes new surrogate models that are not available elsewhere kriging by partial-least squares reduction and energy-minimizing spline interpolation. 13  See also  edit  Business reference model Data governance Model-driven engineering MDE Model-driven architecture MDA Domain Specific Language DSL Domain-Specific Modeling DSM Generic Eclipse Modeling System GEMS Kermeta Kernel Meta-modeling Metadata MetaCASE tool tools for creating tools for computer-aided software engineering tools Method engineering MODAF Meta-Model MOF QueriesViewsTransformations MOF QVT Object Process Methodology Requirements analysis Space mapping Surrogate model Transformation language VIATRA Viatra XML transformation language XML TL References  edit   David R.
