Design From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Drafting of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or of a system process of creation act of creativity and innovation For other uses, see Design disambiguation . A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype , product or process . The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design may also be considered to be a design activity. A design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment . Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints , engineering drawings , business processes , circuit diagrams , and sewing patterns . 1  The person who produces a design is a designer , which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas - usually specifying which area is being dealt with such as a textile designer , fashion designer , product designer , concept designer , web designer  website designer  or interior designer , but also others such as architects and engineers. A designers sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods . The process of creating a design can be brief a quick sketch or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modelling , interactive adjustment and re-design.

Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis, both designers themselves, argued that there are many ways of describing design processes and discussed two basic and fundamentally different ways, 2  both of which have several names. The prevailing view has been called the rational model, 3  technical problem solving 4  and the reason-centric perspective. 5  The alternative view has been called reflection-in-action, 4  co-evolution, 6  and the action-centric perspective. 5  The rational model  edit  The rational model was independently developed by Herbert A. Simon , 7  8  an American scientist, and Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz, two German engineering design theorists. 9  It posits that Designers attempt to optimize a design candidate for known constraints and objectives . The design process is plan-driven. The design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages. The rational model is based on a rationalist philosophy 3  and underlies the waterfall model , 10  systems development life cycle , 11  and much of the engineering design literature. 12  According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner. Example sequence of stages  edit  Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following Pre-production design Design brief or Parti pris   an early often the beginning statement of design goals Analysis   analysis of current design goals Research   investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics Specification   specifying requirements of a design solution for a product  product design specification  13  or service. Problem solving   conceptualizing and documenting design solutions Presentation   presenting design solutions Design during production Development   continuation and improvement of a designed solution Testing   in situ testing of a designed solution Post-production design feedback for future designs Implementation   introducing the designed solution into the environment Evaluation and conclusion   summary of process and results, including constructive criticism and suggestions for future improvements Redesign   any or all stages in the design process repeated with corrections made at any time before, during, or after production. Each stage has many associated best practices . 14  Criticism of the rational model  edit  The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds Designers do not work this way   extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests. 15  5  4  Unrealistic assumptions   goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change. 3  16  The action-centric model  edit  The action-centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model. 5  It posits that Designers use creativity and emotion to generate design candidates. The design process is improvised . No universal sequence of stages is apparent   analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked. 5  The action-centric perspective is based on an empiricist philosophy and broadly consistent with the agile approach 17  and amethodical development. 18  Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers. 15  Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers   by designers thinking on their feet   more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model. Descriptions of design activities  edit  At least two views of design activity are consistent with the action-centric perspective. Both involve three basic activities. In the reflection-in-action paradigm , designers alternate between  framing , making moves, and evaluating moves. Framing refers to conceptualizing the problem, i.e., defining goals and objectives. A move is a tentative design decision. The evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design. 4  In the sensemakingcoevolutionimplementation framework, designers alternate between its three titular activities. Sensemaking includes both framing and evaluating moves. Implementation is the process of constructing the design object. Coevolution is the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context, and vice versa. 5  The concept of the design cycle is understood as a circular time structure, 19  which may start with the thinking of an idea, then expressing it by the use of visual or verbal means of communication design tools, the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea, and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea. Anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression, which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas. 20  Design disciplines  edit  Applied arts Architecture Automotive design Biological design Configuration design Communication design Design management Engineering design Experience design Fashion design Game design Graphic design Information architecture Information design Industrial design Instructional design Interaction design Interior design Landscape architecture Lighting design Modular design Motion graphic design Organization design Product design Process design Service design Social design Software design Sound design Spatial design Strategic design Systems architecture Systems design Systems modeling Urban design User experience design User interface design Web design Philosophies and studies of design  edit  There are countless philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought  which  and among practicing designers. 21  Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. A design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element, to the most holistic influential utopian goals. Design goals are usually for guiding design. However, conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design, perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals. John Heskett, a 20th-century British writer on design claimed, Design, stripped to its essence, can be defined as the human nature to shape and make our environment in ways with out precedent in nature, to serve our needs and give meaning to our lives. 22  Philosophies for guiding design  edit  Design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches hisher practice. Reflections on material culture and environmental concerns  sustainable design  can guide a design philosophy. One example is the First Things First manifesto which was launched within the graphic design community and states We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication   a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design. 23  In The Sciences of the Artificial by polymath Herbert A. Simon , the author asserts design to be a meta-discipline of all professions. Engineers are not the only professional designers. Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones. The intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or t he one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state. Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences. Schools of engineering, as well as schools of architecture, business, education, law, and medicine, are all centrally concerned with the process o f design. 8  Approaches to design  edit  A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer. A combination of approaches may be used if they dont conflict. Some popular approaches include Sociotechnical system design, a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes  for organizational purpose, quality, safety, economics and customer requirements in core work processes, the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society KISS principle , Keep it Simple Stupid, which strives to eliminate unnecessary complications. There is more than one way to do it TIMTOWTDI, a philosophy to allow multiple methods of doing the same thing. Use-centered design , which focuses on the goals and tasks associated with the use of the artifact, rather than focusing on the end user. User-centered design , which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact. Critical design uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture. Service design designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a products use. Transgenerational design , the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living. Speculative design, the speculative design process doesnt necessarily define a specific problem to solve, but establishes a provocative starting point from which a design process emerges. The result is an evolution of fluctuating iteration and reflection using designed objects to provoke questions and stimulate discussion in academic and research settings. Participatory Design originally co-operative design, now often co-design is the practice of collective creativity to design, attempting to actively involve all stakeholders e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable. Participatory design is an approach which is focused on processes and procedures of d esign and is not a design style 24  Methods of designing  edit  Main article Design methods Design methods is a broad area that focuses on Exploring possibilities and constraints by focusing critical thinking skills to research and define problem spaces for existing products or services or the creation of new categories see also Brainstorming  Redefining the specifications of design solutions which can lead to better guidelines for traditional design activities graphic, industrial, architectural, etc. Managing the process of exploring, defining, creating artifacts continually over time Prototyping possible scenarios, or solutions that incrementally or significantly improve the inherited situation Trendspotting  understanding the trend process. Terminology  edit  The word design is often considered ambiguous, as it is applied in varying contexts. The new terminal at Barajas airport in Madrid , Spain Design and art  edit  Today, the term design is generally used for what was formerly called the applied arts . The new term, for a very old thing, was perhaps initiated by Raymond Loewy and teachings at the Bauhaus and Ulm School of Design HfG Ulm in Germany during the 20th century. The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term art and the term design. Applied arts has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of industrial design , graphic design , fashion design , etc. The term  decorative arts  is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects, and also sits within the umbrella of applied arts . In graphic arts 2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration, the distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art , based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded. To a degree, some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the applied arts and fine art . Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are almost instinctive, built-in, natural, and part of our sense of rightness. 25  However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly. A drawing for a booster engine for steam locomotives . Engineering is applied to design, with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science. Design and engineering  edit  In engineering , design is a component of the engineering process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing Product design , Industrial design and Engineering . The American Heritage Dictionary defines design as To conceive or fashion in the mind invent, and To formulate a plan , and defines engineering as The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems. . 26  27  Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of scientific and mathematical principles. The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new human-centered fields of design. 28  How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered  science . Along with the question of what is considered science, there is social science versus natural science . Scientists at Xerox PARC made the distinction of design versus engineering at moving minds versus moving atoms probably in contradiction to the origin of term engineering  engineer from Latin in genio in meaning of a genius what assumes existence of a mind not of an atom. Jonathan Ive has received several awards for his design of Apple Inc. products like this MacBook. In some design fields, personal computers are also used for both design and production Design and production  edit  The relationship between design and production is one of planning and executing. In theory, the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process. Design involves problem-solving and creativity . In contrast, production involves a routine or pre-planned process. A design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers. In some cases, it may be unnecessary or impractical to expect a designer with a broad multidisciplinary knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed specialized knowledge of how to produce the product. Design and production are intertwined in many creative professional careers, meaning problem-solving is part of execution and the reverse. As the cost of rearrangement increases, the need for separating design from production increases as well. For example, a high-budget project, such as a skyscraper , requires separating design architecture from production construction . A Low-budget project, such as a locally printed office party invitation flyer , can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper, a few drops of ink, and less than one hours pay of a desktop publisher . This is not to say that production never involves problem-solving or creativity, nor that design always involves creativity. Designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive. The imperfection of a design may task a production position e.g. production artist , construction worker  with utilizing creativity or problem-solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process. Likewise, a design may be a simple repetition copy of a known preexisting solution, requiring minimal, if any, creativity or problem-solving skills from the designer. An example of a business workflow process using Business Process Model and Notation . Process design  edit  See also Business process management and Method engineering Process design in contrast to design process mentioned above  refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result. Processes in general are treated as a product of design, not the method of design. The term originated with the industrial designing of chemical processes . With the increasing complexities of the information age , consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the design of business processes as well as manufacturing processes .
