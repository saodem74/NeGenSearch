It is published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Computer Society . It was established in 1958. Several breakthroughs in computer science were first reported in the journal,  citation needed  including the Quicksort algorithm proposed by C. A. R. Hoare . 1  The authors of the best paper in each volume receive the Wilkes Award and Medal granted by the British Computer Society . The Computer Journal comprises four sections Section A Computer Science Theory, Methods and Tools Section editor Professor Iain Stewart, Durham University, UK Section A has as its primary focus the theory and methodologies that are central to computer science. The section welcomes contributions from across this spectrum as well as papers involving the novel application of theoretical research or the adaptation of established methodologies to computational problems in other domains or within software tools. Thematic areas include alg orithms and complexity computational logic formal methods heuristic search mathematics of computing models of computation and unconventional computing programming languages and semantics and software engineering. Section B Computer and Communications Networks and Systems Section editor Professor Alan Marshall, University of Liverpool, UK Section B focuses on new theories, ideas and developments in computer and communications networks and related systems. The section seeks high-quality papers reporting new concepts, analyses and experimental results in areas including network architectures and protocols, traffic engineering, resource management and quality of service, network monitoring and traffic measurements , wireless networks, personal and body area networks, vehicular networks, content and service-centric networking, energy efficientgreen networking, opportunistic and cognitive networks, and networking in extremeharsh environments. Section C Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analytics Section editor Professor Fionn Murtagh, University of Huddersfield, UK Section C provides solutions and addresses challenging problems in such areas as data mining, image and signal processing, knowledge-based systems and the semantic web. Further thematic areas covered in this section include computational science, pattern recognition, computer vision, speech processing, machine intelligence and reasoning, web science, information retrieval, and emerging application domains in big data , e-science and u-science. It welcomes submissions with new methodology that is very extensively evaluated, and showing strong and significant results. Section D Security in Computer Systems and Networks Section editor Professor Chris Mitchell, Royal Holloway, University of London, UK The main focus of Section D is the provision of security and privacy in computer systems and networks. Contributions are welcome across all the main areas of information security and privacy, including cryptography and cryptanalysis security protocol design and analysis intrusion detection systems and techniques computer system security hardware and embedded system securit y issues user authentication techniques and systems.
