Management engineering consulting  edit  Large and small engineering driven firms often require the expertise of external management consultants that specialize in companies where engineering practice and product development are key drivers of value. Most engineering management consultants will have as a minimum a professional engineering qualification. But usually they will also have graduate degrees in engineering and or business or a management consulting designation. It involves providing management consulting service that is specific to professional engineering practice or to the engineering industry sector. Engineering management consultancies, are typically boutique firms and have a more specialized focus than the traditional mainstream consulting firms, A T Kearney , Boston Consulting Group , KPMG , PWC , and McKinsey . Applied science and engineering practice requires a holistic approach involving a combination of management art, science, and engineering practice. There are many professional service companies delivering services in a consultancy type relationship to the engineering industry, including law , accounting , human resources , marketing , politics , economics , finance , public affairs , and communication . Commonly, engineering management consultants are used when firms require a combination of special technical knowledge, and management know how, to enhance knowledge or transform organizational performance and also keep any intellectual property developed confidential. Engineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of organizations, people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials andor processes. Management Engineering Consultants strive to improve upon existing organizations, processes, products or systems. Engineering management cons ulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting can focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed. There is also an overlap between engineering management consulting and management science in services that require the adoption of more analytical approaches to problem solving. Examples of where engineering management consulting might be used include developing and leading a company wide business transformation initiative, or designing and implementing a new product development process, designing and implementing a manufacturing engineering process, including an automated assembly workstation. Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of Computer aided design CAD, Computer-aided manufacturing CAM and Computer-aided engineering CAE applications. Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert. It may include using management science techniques to develop a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products referred to as Supply Chain Management , and shortening lines or queues  at a bank, hospital, or a theme park. Management engineering consultants typically use computer simulation especially discrete event simulation , along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization. Professional organizations  edit  There are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management ASEM , which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry. 28  ASEM currently certifies engineering managers two levels via the Certified Associate in Engineering Management CAEM or Certified Professional in Engineering Management CPEM certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a consortium of nine universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree. 29  Also, engineering management graduate programs have the possibility of being accredited by ABET , ATMAE , or ASEM . In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management CSEM is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada EIC, Canadas oldest learned engineering society.
