Established in 1960 under the auspices of UNESCO , IFIP is recognised by the United Nations and links some 50 national and international societies and academies of science with a total membership of over half a million professionals. IFIP is based in Laxenburg , Austria and is an international, non-governmental organisation that operates on a non-profit basis.

Each TC covers a particular aspect of computing and related disciplines, as detailed below. IFIP actively promotes the principle of open access and proceedings for which IFIP holds the copyright are made available electronically via IFIPs Open Access Digital Library . 1  Downloading articles from IFIPs Open DL is not only free of charge, but unlike commercial publishers and other professional organisations, IFIP does not charge authors of open access articles to publish in its Open DL. Conference and workshop organizers who prefer printed proceedings can take advantage of the agreement between IFIP and Springer and publish their proceedings as part of IFIPs Advances in Information and Communication Technology AICT series or in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science LNCS series. Proceedings published by Springer in IFIPs LNCS and AICT series will be included within IFIPs Open DL after an embargo period of three years. An important activity of the IFIP Technical Committees is to organise and sponsor high quality conferences and workshops in the field of ICT. Sponsoring is generally in the form of Best Paper Awards BPA andor Student Travel Grants STG. To assist conference and workshop organisers, IFIP has facilities to host conference websites and supports conference management systems su ch as JEMS, which include export functions that seamlessly integrate with IFIPs Open DL. History  edit  IFIP was established in 1960 under the auspices of UNESCO , originally under the name of the International Federation of Information Processing Societies IFIPS. In preparation, UNESCO had organised the first International Conference on Information Processing, which took place in June 1959 in Paris , and is now considered the first IFIP Congress. The name was changed to IFIP in 1961. The founding president of IFIP was Isaac L. Auerbach 1960 1965. 2  In 2009, IFIP established the International Professional Practice Partnership IFIP IP3 to lead the development of the global ICT profession. 3  4  Technical Committees  edit  IFIPs activities are centered on its 13 Technical Committees, 5  which are divided into Working Groups. These groups, with names like WG 2.4 Software Implementation Technology organise conferences and workshops, distribute technical papers and promote discussion and research outcomes. A full list of IFIP Technical Committees is listed below TC 1 Foundations of Computer Science 6  7  TC 2 SoftwareTheory and Practice TC 3 Education TC 5 Information Technology Applications TC 6 Communication Systems TC 7 System Modeling and Optimization TC 8 Information Systems TC 9 Relationship between Computers and Society 8  TC 10 Computer Systems Technology 9  TC 11 Security and Protection in Information Processing Systems TC 12 Artificial Intelligence TC 13 Human-Computer Interaction TC 14 Entertainment Computing 10  IFIP TC1 Foundations of Computer Science  edit  The current IFIP TC1, which focuses on Foundations of Computer Science, was established in 1997. There was an earlier TC1, covering Terminology, which was IFIPs first Technical Committee. Formed in 1961, it produced a multilingual dictionary of information-processing terminology but was later disbanded. The working groups of the current TC1 are WG 1.1 Continuous Algorithms and Complexity WG 1.2 Descriptional Complexity WG 1.3 Foundations of System Specification WG 1.4 Computational Learning Theory WG 1.5 Cellular Automata and Discrete Complex Systems WG 1.6 Term Rewriting WG 1.7 Theoretical Foundations of Security Analysis and Design WG 1.8 Concurrency Theory WG 1.9 Verified Software joint with WG 2.15 WG 1.10 String Algorithmics  Applications IFIP TC2 Software Theory and Practice  edit  Established in 1962, IFIP TC2 explores Software Theory and Practice with the aim of improving software quality by studying all aspects of the software development process to better understand and enhance programming concepts.

Richard Buckingham of the University of London was appointed its first chairman and TC3 held its initial meeting in Paris in February 1964. 15  The working groups of IFIP TC3 are WG 3.1 Informatics and Digital Technologies in School Education WG 3.3 Research into Educational Applications of Information Technologies WG 3.4 Professional and Vocational Education in ICT WG 3.7 Information Technology in Educational Management IFIP TC5 Information Technology Applications  edit  Established in 1970, IFIP TC5 provides a focus for multi-disciplinary research into the application of information technologies and practices to facilitate information management. It encompasses work in product life-cycle management, digital modelling, virtual product creation, integrated manufacturingproduction management and more. The working groups of IFIP TC5 are WG 5.1 Information Technology in the Product Realization Process WG 5.4 Computer Aided Innovation WG 5.5 Cooperation Infrastructure for Virtual Enterprises and Electronic Business COVE WG 5.7 Advances in Production Management Systems WG 5.8 Enterprise Interoperability WG 5.10 Computer Graphics and Virtual Worlds WG 5.11 Computers and Environment WG 5.12 Architectures for Enterprise Integration WG 5.13 Bioinformatives and its Applications WG 5.14 Advanced Information Processing for Agriculture IFIP TC6 Communication Systems  edit  Established in 1971, IFIP TC6 16  Communication Systems is one of the largest TCs within IFIP in terms of activities and revenues. TC6 has nine Working Groups WGs as well as a number of Special Interest Groups SIGs, the majority of which are concerned either with specific aspects of communications systems themselves or with the application of communications systems. In addition, one WG focuses on communi cations in developing countries. TC6 meets twice a year, in spring and fall, usually co-locating its meetings with a related conference. Examples of TC6 conferences include IFIP Networking, DisCoTec, Middleware, WiOpt, CNSM, Integrated Network Management IM and Wireless Days WD. Membership of a TC6 WG or SIG is open to leading researchers within the field, independent of the national society within the country of origin. Well-known past TC6 members include Vint Cerf, Andr Danthine, Donald Davies, Peter Kirstein, Robert Bob Metcalfe, Louis Pouzin, Otto Spaniol and Hubert Zimmermann. Each WG or SIG elects a chair and vice-chair for a period of thre e years. WG and SIG vice-chairs are, next to the national representatives and some key researchers, automatically members of TC6. TC6 is a strong proponent of open access and the driving force behind the IFIP Open Digital Library DL. The IFIP Open DL is currently operated by TC6 and eventually will move to the INRIA HAL system. To ensure maximum accessibility of accepted papers, several TC6 conferences publish their proceedings not only in the IFIP Open DL, but also in other online systems, such as IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ResearchGate and arXiv. TC6 supports conferences by providing Best Paper Awards usually 500 Euro each as well as Student Travel Grants usually 750 Euro. Conference organisers who intend to obtain IFIP sponsorship are encouraged to fill-in the online Event Request Form ERF. Depending on the category and type of event, IFIP may charge fees to conferences to cover the costs of future awards as we ll as the IFIP secretariat. The working groups of IFIP TC6 are WG 6.1 Architectures and Protocols for Distributed Systems WG 6.2 Network and Internetwork Architectures WG 6.3 Performance of Communication Systems WG 6.4 Internet Applications Engineering WG 6.6 Management of Networks and Distributed Systems WG 6.8 Mobile and Wireless Communications WG 6.9 Communications Systems in Developing Countries WG 6.10 Photonic Networking WG 6.11 Communication Aspects of the E-World WG 6.12 Service-Oriented Systems Joint with WG 8.10WG2.14 In November 2015, a new Special Interest Group on Internet of People IoP was created.
