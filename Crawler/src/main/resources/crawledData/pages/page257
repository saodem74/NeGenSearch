In 1977 he became software engineer at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory , and in 1982 consultant at Yourdon, Inc. . 1  At Yourdon in cooperation with Paul Ward they developed the WardMellor method , and published the book-series Structured Development for Real Time Systems in 1985. Together with Sally Shlaer he founded Project Technology in 1985. That company was acquired by Mentor Graphics in 2004. 1  Mellor stayed as chief scientist of the Embedded Systems Division at Mentor Graphics for another two years, and is self-employed since 2006. Since 1998 Mellor has contributed to the Object Management Group , chairing the consortium that added executable actions to the UML , and the specification of model-driven architecture MDA. He is also chairing the advisory board of the IEEE Software magazine. 2  Since 2013, Mellor has served as CTO for the Industrial Internet Consortium . 3  Publications  edit  1985.
