Requirements engineering From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Defining and maintaining requirements in systems engineering Requirements engineering  RE  1  refers to the process of defining, documenting and maintaining requirements 2  3  in the engineering design process . It is a common role in systems engineering and software engineering . The first use of the term requirements engineering was probably in 1964 in the conference paper Maintenance, Maintainability, and System Requirements Engineering 4  but did not come into general use until the late 1990s with the publication of an IEEE Computer Society tutorial, 5  in March 1997, and the establishment of a conference series on requirements engineering that has evolved into the current International Requirements Engineering Conference . In the waterfall model , 6  requirements engineering is presented as the first phase of the development process. Later development methods, including the Rational Unified Process RUP, for software, assume that requirements engineering continues through the lifetime of a system. Requirement management, which is a sub-function of Systems Engineering practices, is also indexed in the INCOSE International Council on Systems Engineering manuals. Contents 1 Activities 2 Problems 3 Criticism 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Activities  edit  The activities involved in requirements engineering vary widely, depending on the type of system being developed and the specific practices of the organizations involved. 7  These may include Requirements inception or requirements elicitation  Developers and stakeholders meet, the latter are inquired concerning their needs and wants regarding the software product. Requirements analysis and negotiation  Requirements are identified including new ones if the development is iterative and conflicts with stakeholders are solved. Both written and graphical tools the latter commonly used in the design phase but some find them helpful at this stage, too are successfully used as aids. Examples of written analysis tools use cases and user stories . Examples of graphical tools UML 8  and LML . System modeling  Some engineering fields or specific situations require the product to be completely designed and modeled before its construction or fabrication starts and, therefore, the design phase must be performed in advance. For instance, blueprints for a building must be elaborated before any contract can be approved and signed. Many fields might derive models of the system with the Lifecycle Modeling Language , whereas others, might use UML . Note In many fields, such as software engineering, most modeling activities are classified as design activities and not as requirement engineering activities. Requirements specification  Requirements are documented in a formal artifact called a Requirements Specification RS, which will become official only after validation. A RS can contain both written and graphical models information if necessary. Example Software requirements specification SRS. Requirements validation  Checking that the documented requirements and models are consistent and meet the needs of the stakeholder. Only if the final draft passes the validation process, the RS becomes official. Requirements management  Managing all the activities related to the requirements since inception, supervising as the system is developed and, even until after it is put into use e. g., changes, extensions, etc. These are sometimes presented as chronological stages although, in practice, there is considerable interleaving of these activities. Problems  edit  One limited study in Germany presented possible problems in implementing requirements engineering and asked respondents whether they agreed that they were actual problems. The results were not presented as being generalizable but suggested that the principal perceived problems were incomplete requirements, moving targets, and time boxing, with lesser problems being communicatio ns flaws, lack of traceability, terminological problems, and unclear responsibilities. 9  Criticism  edit  There is no evidence that requirements engineering contributes to the success of software projects or systems. Problem structuring, a key aspect of requirements engineering, decreases design performance. 10  Some research suggests that software requirements are often an illusion misrepresenting design decisions as requirements in situations where no real requirements are evident. 11  See also  edit  Requirements analysis , requirements engineering focused in software engineering.
