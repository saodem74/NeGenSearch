ISSN expanded with sequence variant 0 to a GTIN-13 and encoded in an EAN-13 barcode with an EAN-2 add-on designating issue number 13 An International Standard Serial Number  ISSN  is an eight-digit serial number used to uniquely identify a serial publication , such as a magazine. 1  The ISSN is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title. ISSN are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature. 2  The ISSN system was first drafted as an International Organization for Standardization ISO international standard in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975. 3  ISO subcommittee TC 46SC 9 is responsible for maintaining the standard. When a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type , a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in print and electronic media . The ISSN system refers to these types as print ISSN  p-ISSN  and electronic ISSN  e-ISSN , respectively. 4  Conversely, as defined in ISO 32972007, every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned a linking ISSN  ISSN-L , typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium. 5  Contents 1 Code format 2 Code assignment 3 Comparison with other identifiers 3.1 Media versus content 4 Availability 5 Use in URNs 5.1 Problems 6 ISSN variants and labels 6.1 Print ISSN 6.2 Electronic ISSN 6.3 Linking ISSN 7 ROAD 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Code format  edit  The format of the ISSN is an nine digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers. 1  As an integer number , it can be represented by the first seven digits. 6  The last code digit, which may be 0-9 or an X, is a check digit . Formally, the general form of the ISSN code also named ISSN structure or ISSN syntax can be expressed as follows 7  NNNN-NNNC where N is in the set  0,1,2,...,9 , a digit character, and C is in  0,1,2,...,9,X  or by a Perl Compatible Regular Expressions PCRE regular expression  8    0 - 9  4  -  0 - 9  3  0 - 9 xX   . The ISSN of the journal Hearing Research , for example, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, that is C 5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used Calculate the sum of the first seven digits of the ISSN multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the rightthat is, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, respectively 0  8  3  7  7  6  8  5  5  4  9  3  5  2 displaystyle 0cdot 83cdot 77cdot 68cdot 55cdot 49cdot 35cdot 2  0  21  42  40  20  27  10 displaystyle 0214240202710  160 displaystyle 160 The modulus 11 of this sum is then calculated divide the sum by 11 and determine the remainder 160 11  14  remainder   6  14  6 11 displaystyle frac 1601114mbox remainder 614frac 611 If there is no remainder the check digit is 0, otherwise the remainder value is subtracted from 11 to give the check digit 11  6  5 displaystyle 11-65 5 is the check digit, C . For calculations, an upper case X in the check digit position indicates a check digit of 10 like a Roman ten . To confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right if the check digit is X, then add 10 to the sum. The modulus 11 of the sum must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN, based on the above algorithm. 9  10  Code assignment  edit  ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres, usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre based in Paris . The International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between UNESCO and the French government. The International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, the ISDS Register International Serials Data System otherwise known as the ISSN Register . At the end of 2016, update  the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items. 11  Comparison with other identifiers  edit  ISSN and ISBN codes are similar in concept, where ISBNs are assigned to individual books . An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing no information as to the publisher or its location . For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change. Since the ISSN applies to an entire serial a new identifier, the Serial Item and Contribution Identifier SICI, was built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components like the table of contents . Media versus content  edit  Separate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media except reproduction microforms . Thus, the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate ISSNs. 12  Also, a CD-ROM version and a web version of a serial require different ISSNs since two different media are involved. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats e.g. PDF and HTML  of the same online serial. This media-oriented identification of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, and the Web, it makes sense to consider only content , independent of media. This content-oriented identification of serials was a repressed demand during a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials contents model arrived with the indecs Content Model and its application, the digital object identifier DOI, as ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s. Only later, in 2007, ISSN-L was defined in the new ISSN standard ISO 32972007 as an ISSN designated by the ISSN Network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media. 13  Availability  edit  The ISSN Register is not freely available for interrogation on the web, but is available by subscription. There are several routes to the identification and verification of ISSN codes for the public The print version of a serial typically will include the ISSN code as part of the publication information. Most serial websites contain ISSN code information. Derivative lists of publications will often contain ISSN codes these can be found through on-line searches with the ISSN code itself or serial title. WorldCat permits searching its catalog by ISSN, by entering issnISSN code in the query field. One can also go directly to an ISSNs record by appending it to  httpswww.worldcat.orgISSN , e.g. httpswww.worldcat.orgISSN1021-9749 . This does not query the ISSN Register itself, but rather shows whether any Worldcat library holds an item with the given ISSN. Use in URNs  edit  An ISSN can be encoded as a uniform resource name URN by prefixing it with  urnISSN . 14  For example, Rail could be referred to as  urnISSN0953-4563 . URN namespaces are case-sensitive, and the ISSN namespace is all caps. 15  If the checksum digit is X then it is always encoded in uppercase in a URN. Problems  edit  The util URNs are content-oriented , but ISSN is media-oriented ISSN is not unique when the concept is a journal is a set of contents, generally copyrighted content the same journal same contents and same copyrights may have two or more ISSN codes. A URN needs to point to unique content a unique journal as a set of contents reference. Example Nature has an ISSN for print, 0028-0836, and another for the same content on the Web, 1476-4687 only the oldest 0028-0836 is used as a unique identifier . As the ISSN is not unique, the U.S. National Library of Medicine needed to create, prior to 2007, the NLM Unique ID JID. 16  ISSN does not offer resolution mechanisms like a digital object identifier DOI or an URN does, so the DOI is used as a URN for articles, with for historical reasons no need for an ISSNs existence. Example the DOI name 10.1038nature13777 can be represented as an HTTP string by httpsdx.doi.org 10.1038nature13777 , and is redirected resolved to the current articles page but there is no ISSN online service, like httpdx.issn.org , to resolve the ISSN of the journal in this sample 1476-4687 , that is, a kind of httpsdx.issn.org 1476-4687 redirecting to the journals home. A unique URN for serials simplifies the search, recovery and delivery of data for various services including, in particular, search systems and knowledge databases . 13  ISSN-L see Linking ISSN below was created to fill this gap. ISSN variants and labels  edit  There are two most popular media types that adopted special labels indicating below in italics, and one in fact ISSN-variant, with also an optional label. All are used in standard metadata context like JATS , and the labels also, frequently, as abbreviations. Print ISSN  edit  p-ISSN is a standard label for Print ISSN, the ISSN for the print media paper version of a serial. Usually it is the default media, so the default ISSN. Electronic ISSN  edit  e-ISSN or eISSN is a standard label for Electronic ISSN, the ISSN for the electronic media online version of a serial. Linking ISSN  edit  ISSN-L is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media. As defined by ISO 32972007 , the linking ISSN ISSN-L provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource. The ISSN-L is one ISSN number among the existing ISSNs, so, does not change the use or assignment of ordinary ISSNs 17  it is based on the ISSN of the first published medium version of the publication. If the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time, the ISSN of the print version is chosen as the basis of the ISSN-L . With ISSN-L is possible to designate one single ISSN for all those media versions of the title. The use of ISSN-L facilitates search, retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like OpenURL , library catalogues , search engines or knowledge bases . 18  ROAD  edit  ROAD Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources    it  est. 2013, produced by the ISSN International Centre and Unesco 19  See also  edit  CODEN WorldCat  an ISSN-resolve service References  edit   a b What is an ISSN .
