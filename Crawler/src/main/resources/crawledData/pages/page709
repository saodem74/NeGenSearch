Assigned on 19 September 1990, existing onwards. The Soviet Union , a  officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics b   USSR , c  was a Marxist-Leninist sovereign state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. 10  Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics , d  its government and economy were highly centralized . The country was a one-party state , governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Russian SFSR. Other major urban centers were Leningrad , Kiev , Minsk , Tashkent , Alma-Ata , and Novosibirsk . It spanned over 10,000 kilometers 6,200  mi east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometers 4,500  mi north to south. It had five climate zones tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had its roots in the 1917 October Revolution , when the Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II during World War I . In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed by a treaty which legalized the unification of the Russian , Transcaucasian , Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenins death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the states ideology to MarxismLeninism and constructed a command economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization . During his rule, political paranoia fermented and the Great Purge removed Stalins opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrest and persecution of numerous people, resulting in at least 600,000 deaths. 11  In 1933, a major famine struck the country, causing the deaths of three to seven million people. 12  Before the start of World War II in 1939, the Soviets signed the MolotovRibbentrop Pact , a non-aggression agreement with Nazi Germany , after which the USSR invaded Poland . In June 1941, Germany broke the pact and invaded the Soviet Union , opening the largest and bloodiest theater of war in history. Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the effort of acquiring the upper hand over the Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad and Kursk . The territories overtaken by the Red Army became satellite states of the Soviet Union. The post-war division of Europe into capitalist and communist halves led to increased tensions with the United States -led Western Bloc , known as the Cold War . Stalin died in 1953 and was eventually succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev , who in 1956 denounced Stalin and began the de-Stalinization . The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred during Khrushchevs rule, which was among the many factors that led to his downfall in 1964 . In the early 1970s, there was a brief dtente of relations with the United States, but resumed with the SovietAfghan War in 1979. In 1985, the last Soviet premier, Mikhail Gorbachev , sought to reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost openness and perestroika restructuring. These policies caused political instability arising from nationalist and separatist movements. In 1989, Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective communist governments . As part of an attempt to prevent the countrys dissolution, a referendum was held on March 1991 , boycotted by three republics, that resulted in a majority favoring the preservation of the union as a renewed federation . Gorbachevs power was greatly diminished after Russian President Boris Yeltsin s high-profile role in facing down a coup dtat by party hardliners. In late 1991, Gorbachev resigned, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union met and formally dissolved the Soviet Union . The remaining 12 constituent republics emerged as independent post-Soviet states , with the Russian Federation formerly the Russian SFSRassuming the Soviet Unions rights and obligations and being recognized as the successor state . 13  14  15  The Soviet Union produced many significant technological achievements and innovations of the 20th century, including the worlds first human-made satellite , the first humans in space and the first probe to land on another planet, Venus . The country had the worlds second-largest economy and the largest standing military in the world. 16  17  18  The Soviet Union was recognized as one of the five nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction . 19  It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe OSCE, the World Federation of Trade Unions WFTU and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance CMEA and the Warsaw Pact . .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 uldisplaynone Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 3 History 3.1 Revolution and foundation 3.2 Unification of republics 3.3 Stalin era 3.3.1 1930s 3.3.2 World War II 3.3.3 Cold War 3.4 Khrushchev era 3.5 Brezhnev era 3.6 Gorbachev era 3.7 Dissolution 3.7.1 Post-Soviet states 4 Foreign relations 4.1 Early policies 19191939 4.2 World War II 19391945 4.3 Cold War 19451991 5 Politics 5.1 Communist Party 5.2 Government 5.3 Separation of power and reform 5.4 Judicial system 6 Administrative divisions 7 Economy 7.1 Energy 7.2 Science and technology 7.3 Transport 8 Demographics 8.1 Women and fertility 8.2 Education 8.3 Nationalities and ethnic groups 8.4 Health 8.5 Language 8.6 Religion 9 Military 10 Legacy 11 Culture 12 Sport 13 See also 13.1 Conflicts 13.2 Nationalities 14 Notes 15 References 16 Bibliography 17 Further reading 17.1 Surveys 17.2 Lenin and Leninism 17.3 Stalin and Stalinism 17.4 World War II 17.5 Cold War 17.6 Collapse 17.7 Social and economic history 17.8 Nationalities 17.9 Specialty studies 18 External links Etymology Main article Official names of the Soviet Union See also Names of Russia Part of a series on the History of Russia Scythians 11th century BC - 2nd century CE Sarmatians 5th century BC - 4th century CE Goths 2nd5th century Huns 370s-469 Early Slavs  Rus pre-9th century Old Great Bulgaria 632668 Khazar Khaganate 650-969 Rus Khaganate 9th century Volga Bulgaria 9th13th century Kievan Rus 8821240 Cumania 10th century1241 Grand Duchy of Vladimir 11571331 Novgorod Republic 11361478 Golden Horde 1240s1480 Grand Duchy of Moscow 12831547 Tsardom of Russia 15471721 Russian Empire 17211917 Russian Republic 1917 Russian SFSR 19171991 Russian state 19181920 Soviet Union 19221991 Russian Federation 1991present Timeline Russia portal v t e The word  Soviet  is derived from a Russian word  sovt meaning council, assembly, advice, harmony, concord note 1  and all ultimately deriving from the proto-Slavic verbal stem of vt-iti to inform, related to Slavic vst news, English wise, the root in ad-vis-or which came to English through French, or the Dutch weten to know cf. wetenschap meaning science. The word sovietnik means councillor. 20  A number of organizations in Russian history were called council  Russian   . For example, in the Russian Empire the State Council , which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers after the revolt of 1905. 20  During the Georgian Affair , Vladimir Lenin envisioned an expression of Great Russian ethnic chauvinism by Joseph Stalin and his supporters, calling for these nation-states to join Russia as semi-independent parts of a greater union, which he initially named as the Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia  Russian        , tr. Soyz Sovtskikh Respblik Evrpy i zii . 21  Stalin initially resisted the proposal, but ultimately accepted it, although with Lenins agreement changed the name of the newly proposed state to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, albeit all the republics began as Socialist Soviet and did not change to the other order until 1936 . In addition, in the national languages of several republics, the word CouncilConciliar in the respective language was only quite late changed to an adaptation of the Russian Soviet and never in others, e.g. Ukraine . The word  in Latin alphabet SSSR, is the abbreviation of Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in Russian language         . It is written in Cyrillic alphabets , but Latin alphabets users sometimes borrow the word orthographically as CCCP. In some cases, due to the length of its name the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR, primarily when used in the Western media. It was also informally called Russia and its citizens Russians, 22  though that was technically incorrect since Russia was only one of the republics. 23  Geography Main article Geography of the Soviet Union With an area of 22,402,200 square kilometres 8,649,500  sq  mi, the Soviet Union was the world s largest country, a status that is retained by the Russian Federation . 24  Covering a sixth of Earth s land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America . 25  The European portion accounted for a quarter of the countrys area and was the cultural and economic center. The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia , was much less populous. It spanned over 10,000 kilometres 6,200  mi east to west across 11 time zones , and over 7,200 kilometres 4,500  mi north to south. It had five climate zones tundra , taiga , steppes , desert and mountains . The Soviet Union had the worlds longest border , like Russia , measuring over 60,000 kilometres 37,000  mi, or  1   1  2 circumferences of Earth . Two-thirds of it was a coastline . Across the Bering Strait was the United States . The Soviet Union bordered Afghanistan , China , Czechoslovakia , Finland , Hungary , Iran , Mongolia , North Korea , Norway , Poland , Romania , and Turkey from 1945 to 1991. The Soviet Unions highest mountain was Communism Peak now Ismoil Somoni Peak  in Tajikistan , at 7,495 metres 24,590  ft. The Soviet Union also included most of the worlds largest lakes the Caspian Sea shared with Iran , and Lake Baikal , the worlds largest and deepest freshwater lake that is also an internal body of water in Russia.

Gorbachev Culture Economy Education Geography Politics Soviet Union portal v t e The last Russian Tsar , Nicholas II , ruled the Russian Empire until his abdication on March 1917 in the aftermath of the February Revolution , due in part to the strain of fighting in World War I , which lacked public support. A short-lived Russian Provisional Government took power, only to be overthrown in the October Revolution  N.S. 7 November 1917 by revolutionaries led by the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin . 26  The Soviet Union was officially established on December 1922 with the union of the Russian , Ukrainian , Byelorussian , and Transcaucasian Soviet republics, each ruled by local Bolshevik parties. Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term Soviet Russia    strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic    was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians. Revolution and foundation Main article History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union 191727 Modern revolutionary activity in the Russian Empire began with the 1825 Decembrist revolt . Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries. A parliamentthe State Duma was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905 , but Tsar Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to a constitutional monarchy . Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major cities. Lenin , Trotsky and Kamenev celebrating the second anniversary of the October Revolution A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd , in response to the wartime decay of Russias economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of the imperial government on March 1917. The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I. At the same time, workers councils , known in Russian as  Soviets , sprang up across the country. The Bolsheviks , led by Vladimir Lenin , pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets. On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets. This event would later be officially known in Soviet bibliographies as the Great October Socialist Revolution . In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers , though by February 1918, fighting had resumed. In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war for good and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk . A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites , starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds victory. It included foreign intervention , the execution of the former tsar and his family , and the famine of 1921 , which killed about five million people. 27  On March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland , the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established Republic of Finland , the Republic of Estonia , the Republic of Latvia , and the Republic of Lithuania . Unification of republics On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR , the Transcaucasian SFSR , the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR 28  and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR , forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. 29  These two documents were confirmed by the first Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, 30  Mikhail Kalinin , Mikhail Tskhakaya , Mikhail Frunze , Grigory Petrovsky , and Alexander Chervyakov , 31  on 30 December 1922. The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre . On 1 February 1924, the USSR was recognized by the United Kingdom. The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimising the December 1922 union. An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917. A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees , government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin. One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan , which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country. The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15-year period. It included the construction of a network of 30 regional power stations , including ten large hydroelectric power plants , and numerous electric-powered large industrial enterprises. 32  The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931. 33  Stalin era Main articles History of the Soviet Union 192753 and Excess mortality in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin From its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party Bolsheviks . 34  After the economic policy of  War communism  during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s, and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax. The stated purpose of the one-party state was to ensure that capitalist exploitation would not return to the Soviet Union and that the principles of democratic centralism would be most effective in representing the peoples will in a practical manner. The debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenins death in 1924. Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a  troika  consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR , Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR , and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR . On 3 April 1922, Stalin was named the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union . Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers and Peasants Inspectorate , which gave Stalin considerable power. By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmanoeuvring his rivals within the party , Stalin became the undisputed leader of the Soviet Union and, by the end of the 1920s, established a totalitarian rule. On October 1927, Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile. .mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerdisplayflexflex-directioncolumn.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowdisplayflexflex-directionrowclearleftflex-wrapwrapwidth100box-sizingborder-box.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglemargin1pxfloatleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .theaderclearbothfont-weightboldtext-aligncenteralign-selfcenterbackground-colortransparentwidth100.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-alignleftbackground-colortransparent.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-lefttext-alignleft.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-righttext-alignright.mw-parser-output .tmulti .text-align-centertext-aligncentermedia all and max-width720px.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbinnerwidth100importantbox-sizingborder-boxmax-wi dthnoneimportantalign-itemscenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .trowjustify-contentcenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .tsinglefloatnoneimportantmax-width100importantbox-sizingborder-boxtext-aligncenter.mw-parser-output .tmulti .thumbcaptiontext-aligncenter USSR in 1922 and 1936 Russian SFSR in red . In 1928, Stalin introduced the first five-year plan for building a socialist economy . In place of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it aimed to build Socialism in One Country . In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization . In agriculture , rather than adhering to the lead by example policy advocated by Lenin, 35  forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country. In the 1930s , homosexuality was re-criminalized across the whole of the Soviet Union. Henceforth, anyone involved in homosexual acts could be sent to prison for up to five years. Famines ensued, causing millions of deaths surviving kulaks were persecuted, and many were sent to Gulags to do forced labor . 36  Social upheaval continued in the mid-1930s. Stalins Great Purge resulted in the execution or detainment of many  Old Bolsheviks  who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin. According to declassified Soviet archives, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people in 1937 and 1938, of whom 681,692 were shot. 11  Over those two years, there were an average of over one thousand executions a day. 37  e  Despite the turmoil of the mid-to-late 1930s, the country developed a robust industrial economy in the years preceding World War II . Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union, there was a government-sponsored program of forced conversion to atheism  conducted by the Communists. 41  42  43  The regime targeted religions based on state interests, and while most organised religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools. 44  In 1925, the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the propaganda campaign. 45  Accordingly, although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned, a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the formal structures and mass media, and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers to be openly religious. As for the Russian Orthodox Church, Soviet authorities sought to control it and, in times of national crisis, to exploit it for the regimes own purposes but their ultimate goal was to eliminate it. During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests. Many others were imprisoned or exiled. Believers were harassed and persecuted. Most seminaries were closed, and th e publication of most religious material was prohibited. By 1941, only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence before World War I. 1930s Sergei Korolev , the father of the Soviet space program , shortly after his arrest during Stalins Great Terror Closer cooperation between the Soviet Union and the West developed in the early 1930s. From 1932 to 1934, the Soviet Union participated in the World Disarmament Conference . In 1933, diplomatic relations between the United States and the USSR were established when in November, the newly elected President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, chose to recognize Stalins Communist government formally and negotiated a new trade agreement between the two countries. 46  On September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations . After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists , who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany . On December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new Soviet Constitution . Supporters around the world hailed it as the most democratic Constitution imaginable. Historian J. Arch Getty concludes .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 Many who lauded Stalins Soviet Union as the most democratic country on earth lived to regret their words. After all, the Soviet Constitution of 1936 was adopted on the eve of the Great Terror of the late 1930s the thoroughly democratic elections to the first Supreme Soviet permitted only uncontested candidates and took place at the height of the savage violence in 1937. The civil rights, personal freedoms, and democratic forms promised in the Stalin constitution were trampled almost immediately and remained dead letters until long after Stalins death. 47  In 1939, the Soviet Union made a dramatic shift toward Nazi Germany. Almost a year after Britain and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the Soviet Union made agreements with Germany as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks . The two countries concluded the MolotovRibbentrop Pact and the GermanSoviet Commercial Agreement in August 1939. The former made possible the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia , Bessarabia, northern Bukovina , and eastern Poland . In late November, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres 16  mi back from Leningrad , Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland . In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939. However, on April 1941, the USSR signed the SovietJapanese Neutrality Pact with Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo , a Japanese puppet state . World War II Main articles Eastern Front World War II , World War II casualties of the Soviet Union , and German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war World War II military deaths in Europe and military situation in autumn 1944 The Battle of Stalingrad is considered by many historians as a decisive turning point of World War II. Germany broke the MolotovRibbentrop Pact and invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 , starting what was known in the USSR as the  Great Patriotic War . The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow , aided by an unusually harsh winter. The Battle of Stalingrad , which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to Germany from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war. After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945 . The German Army suffered 80 of its military deaths in the Eastern Front. 48  The same year, the USSR, in fulfilment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference , denounced the SovietJapanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 49  and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945. 50  This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II. Left to right Soviet General Secretary Stalin , US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill confer in Tehran in 1943. The Soviet Union suffered greatly in the war, losing around 27 million people . 51  Approximately 2.8 million Soviet POWs died of starvation, mistreatment, or executions in just eight months of 194142. 52  53  During the war, the Soviet Union together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered the Big Four Allied powers, 54  and later became the Four Policemen that formed the basis of the United Nations Security Council . 55  It emerged as a superpower in the post-war period. Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world, the Soviet Union had official relations with practically every country by the late 1940s. A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the Soviet Union became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council , which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions. Memorandum for the Presidents Special Assistant Harry Hopkins , Washington, D.C., 10 August 1943 In War II Russia occupies a dominant position and is the decisive factor looking toward the defeat of the Axis in Europe. While in Sicily the forces of Great Britain and the United States are being opposed by 2 German divisions, the Russian front is receiving attention of approximately 200 German divisions. Whenever the Allies open a second front on the Continent, it will be decidedly a secondary front to that of Russia theirs will continue to be the main effort. Without Russia in the war, the Axis cannot be defeated in Europe, and the position of the United Nations becomes precarious. Similarly, Russias post-war position in Europe will be a dominant one. With Germany crushed, there is no power in Europe to oppose her tremendous military forces. 56  The Soviet Union maintained its status as one of the worlds two superpowers for four decades through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to developing countries , and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry. 57  Cold War Main article Cold War Nikita Khrushchev, Nikolai Podgorny and Walter Ulbricht in Berlin, East Germany , 1963 During the immediate postwar period, the Soviet Union rebuilt and expanded its economy, while maintaining its strictly centralized control . It took effective control over most of the countries of Eastern Europe except Yugoslavia and later Albania , turning them into satellite states . The Soviet Union bound its satellite states in a military alliance, the Warsaw Pact , in 1955, and an economic organization, The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon, a counterpart to the European Economic Community EEC, from 1949 to 1991. 58  The Soviet Union concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germanys industrial plants, and it exacted war reparations from East Germany , Hungary , Romania , and Bulgaria using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It also instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately 15 billion to 20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan . 59  Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Communist Party of China , and its influence grew elsewhere in the world. Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Unions wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies. In the ensuing Cold War , the two sides clashed indirectly in proxy wars . Khrushchev era Main article History of the Soviet Union 195364 Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev left with John F. Kennedy in Vienna, 3 June 1961 Stalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by Georgy Malenkov . This did not last, however, and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s. In 1956, he denounced Stalins use of repression and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society. This was known as de-Stalinization . Map showing greatest territorial extent of the Soviet Union and the states that it dominated politically, economically and militarily in 1960, after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 but before the official Sino-Soviet split of 1961 Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders, in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1941. For this reason, the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states, dependent upon and subservient to its leadership. Soviet military force was used to suppress anti-Stalinist uprisings in Hungary and Poland in 1956. In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the USSRs rapprochement with the West, and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchevs revisionism , led to the SinoSoviet split . This resulted in a break throughout the global MarxistLeninist movement, with the governments in Albania , Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China. During this period of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union continued to realize scientific and technological exploits in the Space Race , rivaling the United States launching the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 in 1957 a living dog named Laika in 1957 the first human being, Yuri Gagarin in 1961 the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova in 1963 Alexei Leonov , the first person to walk in space in 1965 the first soft landing on the Moon by spacecraft Luna 9 in 1966 and the first Moon rovers, Lunokhod 1 and Lunokhod 2 . 60  Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin , the first human to travel into space Khrushchev initiated  The Thaw , a complex shift in political, cultural and economic life in the Soviet Union. This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing living standards to rise dramatically while maintaining high levels of economic growth. Censorship was relaxed as well. Khrushchevs reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive. In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba . An agreement was made between the Soviet Union and the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey , concluding the crisis. This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964. Brezhnev era Main articles History of the Soviet Union 196482 , History of the Soviet Union 198291 , and Era of Stagnation Following the ousting of Khrushchev, another period of collective leadership ensued, consisting of Leonid Brezhnev as General Secretary, Alexei Kosygin as Premier and Nikolai Podgorny as Chairman of the Presidium, lasting until Brezhnev established himself in the early 1970s as the preeminent Soviet leader. Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and US President Jimmy Carter sign the SALT II arms limitation treaty in Vienna on 18 June 1979 In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms. In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion along with the earlier invasions of Eastern European states by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine , which claimed the right of the Soviet Union to violate the sovereignty of any country that attempted to replace MarxismLeninism with capitalism. Brezhnev presided throughout dtente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control  SALT I , SALT II , Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty  while at the same time building up Soviet military might. In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted. The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnevs death in 1982 was one of aversion to change. The long period of Brezhnevs rule had come to be dubbed one of standstill, with an ageing and ossified top political leadership. This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation, a period of adverse economic, political, and social effects in the Soviet Union, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko . Gorbachev era Main articles Cold War 198591 , History of the Soviet Union 198291 , and 1991 Soviet coup dtat attempt Mikhail Gorbachev in one-to-one discussions with US President Ronald Reagan Two developments dominated the decade that followed the increasingly apparent crumbling of the Soviet Unions economic and political structures, and the patchwork attempts at reforms to reverse that process. Kenneth S. Deffeyes argued in Beyond Oil that the Reagan administration encouraged Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to the point where the Soviets could not make a profit selling their oil, and resulted in the depletion of the USSRs hard currency reserves. 61  Brezhnevs next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long. Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power both died in less than two years. In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev . He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika . His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship. Reagan greets a young boy while touring Red Square with Gorbachev during the Moscow Summit , 31 May 1988 Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War. In 1988, the Soviet Union abandoned its nine-year war in Afghanistan and began to withdraw its forces. In the late 1980s, he refused military support to the governments of the Soviet Unions satellite states,  clarify  which paved the way for Revolutions of 1989 . With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and with East Germany and West Germany pursuing unification, the Iron Curtain between the West and Soviet-controlled regions came down. At the same time, the constituent republics of the Soviet Union started legal moves towards potentially declaring sovereignty over their territories, citing Article 72 of the USSR constitution, which stated that any constituent republic was free to secede. 62  On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum. 63  Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990. Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the  War of Laws . In 1989, the Russian SFSR , which was then the largest constituent republic with about half of the population convened a newly elected Congress of Peoples Deputies. Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russias sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSRs laws. After a landslide victory of Sjdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990. A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics the remainder having boycotted the vote, with the majority of the population in those nine republics voting for preservation of the Union. The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost. In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty , which would have turned the Soviet Union into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics. The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup an attempted coup dtat by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachevs reforms and reassert the central governments control over the republics. After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachevs power was effectively ended. The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics. In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence following Lithuanias 1990 example. Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the partys activities were indefinitely suspendedeffectively ending its rule. By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia on July 1991. Dissolution Main articles Dissolution of the Soviet Union and Commonwealth of Independent States The remaining 12 republics continued discussing new, increasingly looser, models of the Union. However, by December all except Russia and Kazakhstan had formally declared independence. During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Moscow Kremlin . The final blow was struck on 1 December when Ukraine, the second most powerful republic, voted overwhelmingly for independence . Ukraines secession ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying together even on a limited scale. Changes in national boundaries after the end of the Cold War On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus formerly Byelorussia, signed the Belavezha Accords , which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States CIS in its place. While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol , which confirmed the accords. On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct. He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin. That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place. The following day, the Supreme Soviet , the highest governmental body of the Soviet Union, voted both itself and the Soviet Union out of existence. This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state, and the end of the Cold War . 64  The Soviet Army initially remained under overall CIS command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states. The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991, Russia was internationally recognized 65  as its legal successor on the international stage. To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed Soviet overseas properties as its own. Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol , Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics. Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Unions rights and obligations. Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law On Legal Succession of Ukraine . Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the USSR. Internally displaced Azerbaijanis from Nagorno-Karabakh, 1993 Country emblems of the Soviet Republics before and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union note that the Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic fifth in the second row no longer exists as a political entity of any kind and the emblem is unofficial. The dissolution of the Soviet Union was followed by a severe economic contraction, deteriorating social conditions, and a catastrophic fall in living standards in post-Soviet states , 66  67  including a rapid increase in poverty, 68  69  70  71  crime, 72  73  corruption, 74  75  unemployment, 76  homelessness, 77  78  rates of disease, 79  80  81  demographic losses, 82  income inequality and the rise of an oligarchical class , 83  68  along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income. 84  Between 19881989 and 19931995, the Gini ratio increased by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries. 68  The economic shocks that accompanied wholesale privatization were associated with sharp increases in mortality. Data shows Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42 increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994. 85  86  In the following decades, only five or six of the post-communist states are on a path to joining the wealthy capitalist West while most are falling behind, some to such an extent that it will take over fifty years to catch up to where they were before the fall of the Soviet Bloc. 87  88  In summing up the international ramifications of these events, Vladislav Zubok stated The collapse of the Soviet empire was an event of epochal geopolitical, military, ideological, and economic significance. 89  Post-Soviet states Main article Post-Soviet states The analysis of the succession of states with respect to the 15 post-Soviet states is complex. The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union. It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council . There are additionally four states that claim independence from the other internationally recognized post-Soviet states but possess limited international recognition  Abkhazia , Nagorno-Karabakh , South Ossetia , and Transnistria . The Chechen separatist movement of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria lacks any international recognition. Foreign relations Main article Foreign relations of the Soviet Union 1960s Cuba-Soviet friendship poster with Fidel Castro and Nikita Khrushchev Gerald Ford , Leonid Brezhnev and Henry Kissinger speaking informally at the Vladivostok Summit in 1974 Mikhail Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signing bilateral documents during Gorbachevs official visit to the United States in 1990 During his rule, Stalin always made the final policy decisions. Otherwise, Soviet foreign policy was set by the Commission on the Foreign Policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , or by the partys highest body the Politburo . Operations were handled by the separate Ministry of Foreign Affairs . It was known as the Peoples Commissariat for Foreign Affairs or Narkomindel, until 1946. The most influential spokesmen were Georgy Chicherin 18721936, Maxim Litvinov 18761951, Vyacheslav Molotov 18901986, Andrey Vyshinsky 18831954 and Andrei Gromyko 19091989. Intellectuals were based in the Moscow State Institute of International Relations . 90  Comintern 19191943, or Communist International , was an international communist organization based in the Kremlin that advocated world communism . The Comintern intended to struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state. 91  It was abolished as a conciliatory measure toward Britain and the United States. 92  Comecon , the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance  Russian    , Sovet Ekonomicheskoy Vzaimopomoshchi , , SEV was an economic organization from 1949 to 1991 under Soviet control that comprised the countries of the Eastern Bloc along with several communist states elsewhere in the world. Moscow was concerned about the Marshall Plan , and Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and Southeast Asia. Comecon was the Eastern Blocs reply to the formation in Western Europe of the Organization for European Economic Co-Operation OEEC, 93  94  The Warsaw Pact was a collective defence alliance formed in 1955 among the Soviet Union and seven Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe during the Cold War. The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Comecon, the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe. The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO . 95  The Cominform 19471956, informally the Communist Information Bureau and officially the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers Parties, was the first official agency of the international communist movement since the dissolution of the Comintern in 1943. Its role was to coordinate actions between communist parties under Soviet direction. Stalin used it to order Western European communist parties to abandon their exclusively parliamentarian line and instead concentrate on politically impeding the operations of the Marshall Plan. 96  It also coordinated international aid to communist insurgents during the Greek Civil War in 19471949. 97  It expelled Yugoslavia in 1948 after Josip Broz Tito insisted on an independent program. Its newspaper, For a Lasting Peace, for a Peoples Democracy , promoted Stalins positions. The Cominforms concentration on Europe meant a deemphasis on world revolution in Soviet foreign policy. By enunciating a uniform ideology, it allowed the constituent parties to focus on personalities rather than issues. 98  Early policies 19191939 Further information International relations 19191939   Soviet Union 1987 Soviet stamp The Communist leadership of the Soviet Union intensely debated foreign policy issues and change directions several times. Even after Stalin assumed dictatorial control in the late 1920s, there were debates, and he frequently changed positions. 99  During the countrys early period, it was assumed that Communist revolutions would break out soon in every major industrial country, and it was the Soviet responsibility to assist them. The Comintern was the weapon of choice. A few revolutions did break out, but they were quickly suppressed the longest lasting one was in Hungarythe Hungarian Soviet Republic lasted only from 21 March 1919 to 1 August 1919. The Russian Bolsheviks were in no position to give any help. By 1921, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin realized that capitalism had stabilized itself in Europe and there would not be any widespread revolutions anytime soon. It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia, and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead. Russia was now a pariah state, along with Germany. The two came to terms in 1922 with the Treaty of Rapallo that settled long-standing grievances. At the same time, the two countries secretly set up training programs for the illegal German army and air force operations at hidden camps in the Soviet Union. 100  Moscow eventually stopped threatening other states, and instead worked to open peaceful relationships in terms of trade, and diplomatic recognition. The United Kingdom dismissed the warnings of Winston Churchill and a few others about a continuing communist threat, and opened trade relations and de facto diplomatic recognition in 1922. There was hope for a settlement of the pre-war tsarist debts, but it was repeatedly postponed. Formal recognition came when the new Labor Party came to power in 1924. 101  All the other countries followed suit in opening trade relations. Henry Ford opened large-scale business relations with the Soviets in the late 1920s, hoping that it would lead to long-term peace. Finally, in 1933, the United States officially recognized the Soviet Union, a decision backed by the public opinion and especially by US business interests that expected an opening of new profitable market. 102  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Stalin ordered Communist parties across the world to strongly oppose non-communist political parties, labor unions or other organizations on the left. Stalin reversed himself in 1934 with the Popular Front program that called on all Communist parties to join together with all anti-Fascist political, labor, and organizational forces that were opposed to fascism , especially of the Nazi variety. 103  104  World War II 19391945 Main articles Causes of World War II and Diplomatic history of World War II   Soviet Union This section is empty.

In turn, the Central Committee voted for a Politburo called the Presidium between 19521966, Secretariat and the General Secretary First Secretary from 1953 to 1966, the de facto highest office in the Soviet Union. 106  Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country 107  except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941. 108  They were not controlled by the general party membership, as the key principle of the party organization was democratic centralism , demanding strict subordination to higher bodies, and elections went uncontested, endorsing the candidates proposed from above. 109  The Communist Party maintained its dominance over the state mainly through its control over the system of appointments . All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU. Of the party heads themselves, Stalin 19411953 and Khrushchev 19581964 were Premiers. Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, 110  but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the mostly ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet , the nominal head of state . The institutions at lower levels were overseen and at times supplanted by primary party organizations . 111  However, in practice, the degree of control the party was able to exercise over the state bureaucracy, particularly after the death of Stalin, was far from total, with the bureaucracy pursuing different interests that were at times in conflict with the party. 112  Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned. 113  Government Main article Government of the Soviet Union The Grand Kremlin Palace , seat of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union , 1982 The Supreme Soviet successor of the Congress of Soviets and Central Executive Committee  was nominally the highest state body for most of the Soviet history, 114  at first acting as a rubber stamp institution, approving and implementing all decisions made by the party. However, its powers and functions were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees. It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the government budget . 115  The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium to wield its power between plenary sessions, 116  ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court , 117  the Procurator General 118  and the Council of Ministers known before 1946 as the Council of Peoples Commissars , headed by the Chairman Premier and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society. 116  State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990. Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees , local Soviets and executive committees . While the state system was nominally federal, the party was unitary. 119  The state security police the KGB and its predecessor agencies played an important role in Soviet politics. It was instrumental in the Great Purge , 120  but was brought under strict party control after Stalins death. Under Yuri Andropov , the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, 121  culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 122  Separation of power and reform Main article Perestroika Nationalist anti-government riots in Dushanbe , Tajikistan , 1990 The constitution , which were promulgated in 1918 , 1924 , 1936 and 1977 , 123  did not limit state power. No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers 124  that represented executive and legislative branches of the government. The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed. Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin 125  and Stalin, 126  as well as after Khrushchevs dismissal, 127  itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee. 128  All leaders of the Communist Party before Gorbachev died in office, except Georgy Malenkov 129  and Khrushchev, both dismissed from the party leadership amid internal struggle within the party. 128  Between 1988 and 1990, facing considerable opposition, Mikhail Gorbachev enacted reforms shifting power away from the highest bodies of the party and making the Supreme Soviet less dependent on them. The Congress of Peoples Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held on March 1989. The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, and much stronger than before. For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers. 130  In 1990, Gorbachev introduced and assumed the position of the President of the Soviet Union , concentrated power in his executive office, independent of the party, and subordinated the government, 131  now renamed the Cabinet of Ministers of the USSR , to himself. 132  Tensions grew between the Union-wide authorities under Gorbachev, reformists led in Russia by Boris Yeltsin and controlling the newly elected Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR , and communist hardliners. On 1921 August 1991, a group of hardliners staged a coup attempt . The coup failed, and the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power in the period of transition. 133  Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR. 134  Judicial system Main article Law of the Soviet Union See also Socialist law The judiciary was not independent of the other branches of government. The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts  Peoples Court  and applied the law as established by the constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet. The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts. The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law , where the judge, procurator , and defence attorney collaborate to establish the truth. 135  Administrative divisions Main articles Soviet republic system of government and Republics of the Soviet Union Constitutionally, the USSR was a federation of constituent Union Republics, which were either unitary states, such as Ukraine or Byelorussia SSRs, or federations, such as Russia or Transcaucasia SFSRs, 105  all four being the founding republics who signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR in December 1922. In 1924, during the national delimitation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were formed from parts of Russias Turkestan ASSR and two Soviet dependencies, the Khorezm and Bukharan SSRs . In 1929, Tajikistan was split off from the Uzbekistan SSR. With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status. 136  On August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of the Ukraine and Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina . Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania SSRs were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation . Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic on March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956. Between July 1956 and September 1991, there were 15 union republics see map below. 137  While nominally a union of equals, in practice the Soviet Union was dominated by Russians . The domination was so absolute that for most of the Soviet Unions existence, it was commonly but incorrectly referred to as Russia. While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest both in terms of population and geography, most powerful, most developed, and the industrial center of the Soviet Union. Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the Soviet Unions federal structure was window dressing for Russian dominance. For that reason, the people of the Soviet Union were usually called Russians, not Soviets, since everyone knew who really ran the show. 138  Republic Map of the Union Republics between 19561991 1   Russian SFSR 2   Ukrainian SSR 3   Byelorussian SSR 4   Uzbek SSR 5   Kazakh SSR 6   Georgian SSR 7   Azerbaijan SSR 8   Lithuanian SSR 9   Moldavian SSR 10   Latvian SSR 11   Kirghiz SSR 12   Tajik SSR 13   Armenian SSR 14   Turkmen SSR 15   Estonian SSR Economy Main article Economy of the Soviet Union The Soviet Union in comparison to other countries by GDP nominal per capita in 1965 based on a West-German school book 1971      5,000 DM    2,500  5,000 DM    1,000  2,500 DM    500  1,000 DM    250  500 DM      250 DM The Soviet Union became the first country to adopt a command economy , whereby production and distribution of goods were centralized and directed by the government. The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism , which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and free trade . After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war communism by the New Economic Policy NEP in 1921, legalising free trade and private ownership of small businesses. The economy quickly recovered as a result. 139  After a long debate among the members of Politburo about the course of economic development, by 19281929, upon gaining control of the country, Stalin abandoned the NEP and pushed for full central planning, starting forced collectivization of agriculture and enacting draconian labor legislation. Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization , which significantly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s. 139  The primary motivation for industrialization was preparation for war, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalist world. 140  As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II . 141  The war caused extensive devastation of the Soviet economy and infrastructure, which required massive reconstruction. 142  The DneproGES , one of many hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient  for most of the period until the creation of Comecon , only a tiny share of domestic products was traded internationally. 143  After the creation of the Eastern Bloc , external trade rose rapidly. Still, the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade . 144  Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s. 143  During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry. At the same time, the Soviet Union became the largest arms exporter to the Third World . Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states . 143  Picking cotton in Armenia in the 1930s From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged. The economy was formally directed by central planning , carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans . However, in practice, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors. All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership. Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods. Credit was discouraged, but widespread. The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting. Although in theory prices were legally set from above, in practice they were often negotiated, and informal horizontal links between producer factories etc. were widespread. 139  A number of basic services were state-funded, such as education and health care. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defence were prioritized over consumer goods . 145  Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited variety. Under the command economy, consumers had almost no influence on production, and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices. 146  A massive unplanned second economy grew up at low levels alongside the planned one, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not. The legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965 . 139  Workers of the Salihorsk potash plant, Belarus , 1968 Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, 147  148  by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s. During the 1950s and 1960s, it had comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West. 149  However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries, despite a rapid increase in the capital stock the rate of capital increase was only surpassed by Japan. 139  Overall, between 1960 and 1989, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union was slightly above the world average based on 102 countries.  citation needed  According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly , growth could have been faster. By their calculation, per capita income of the Soviet Union in 1989 should have been twice higher than it was, considering the amount of investment, education and population. The authors attribute this poor performance to the low productivity of capital. 150  Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living declined due to Stalins despotism, and while there was a brief improvement after his death, it lapsed into stagnation. 151  In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev attempted to reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika . His policies relaxed state control over enterprises but did not replace it by market incentives, resulting in a sharp decline in output. The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues , started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and the property was still largely state-owned until after the countrys dissolution. 139  146  For most of the period after World War II until its collapse, Soviet GDP  PPP  was the second-largest in the world , and third during the second half of the 1980s, 152  although on per-capita basis, it was behind that of First World countries. 153  Compared to countries with similar per-capita GDP in 1928, the Soviet Union experienced significant growth. 154  In 1990, the Soviet Union had a Human Development Index of 0.920, placing it in the high category of human development. It was the third-highest in the Eastern Bloc , behind Czechoslovakia and East Germany , and the 25th in the world of 130 countries. 155  Energy Main article Energy policy of the Soviet Union Soviet stamp depicting the 30th anniversary of the International Atomic Energy Agency , published in 1987, a year following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster The need for fuel declined in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, 156  both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product. At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower,  clarification needed  only 2.6. 157  David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSRs collapse. 158  The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 22.5 during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields.  clarification needed  159  However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the countrys high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World . 160  In 1991, the Soviet Union had a pipeline network of 82,000 kilometres 51,000  mi for crude oil and another 206,500 kilometres 128,300  mi for natural gas. 161  Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported. 162  In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency . 143  At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second-largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia . 163  Science and technology Main article Science and technology in the Soviet Union Soviet stamp showing the orbit of Sputnik 1 The Soviet Union placed great emphasis on science and technology within its economy, 164  however, the most remarkable Soviet successes in technology, such as producing the worlds first space satellite , typically were the responsibility of the military. 145  Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding. Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenins belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations. In the early 1960s, the Soviets awarded 40 of chemistry PhDs to women, compared to only 5 in the United States. 165  By 1989, Soviet scientists were among the worlds best-trained specialists in several areas, such as energy physics , selected areas of medicine, mathematics, welding and military technologies. Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy , the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World . Under the Reagan administration , Project Socrates determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using. In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors. In contrast, the Soviet Union was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage. However, the Soviet Unions technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility. This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform. 166  167  168  Transport Main article Transport in the Soviet Union Aeroflot s flag during the Soviet era Transport was a vital component of the countrys economy. The economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of Aeroflot , an aviation enterprise . 169  The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air. 161  However, due to inadequate maintenance, much of the road, water and Soviet civil aviation transport were outdated and technologically backward compared to the First World. 170  Soviet rail transport was the largest and most intensively used in the world 170  it was also better developed than most of its Western counterparts. 171  By the late 1970s and early 1980s, Soviet economists were calling for the construction of more roads to alleviate some of the burdens from the railways and to improve the Soviet government budget . 172  The street network and automotive industry 173  remained underdeveloped, 174  and dirt roads were common outside major cities. 175  Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had. By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones. 175  Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction. 176  The underdeveloped road network led to a growing demand for public transport. 177  Despite improvements, several aspects of the transport sector were still  when  riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making. Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services. The Soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world. 161  Demographics Main article Demographics of the Soviet Union Population of the Soviet Union red and the post-Soviet states blue from 1961 to 2009 as well as projection dotted blue from 2010 to 2100 Excess deaths throughout World War I and the Russian Civil War including the postwar famine  amounted to a combined total of 18 million, 178  some 10 million in the 1930s, 38  and more than 26 million in 19415. The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued. 51  According to Catherine Merridale , ... reasonable estimate would place the total number of excess deaths for the whole period somewhere around 60 million. 179  The birth rate of the USSR decreased from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, mainly due to increasing urbanization and the rising average age of marriages. The mortality rate demonstrated a gradual decrease as well  from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974. In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the postWorld War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanistion and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics. 180  Soviet Europe moved towards sub-replacement fertility , while Soviet Central Asia continued to exhibit population growth well above replacement-level fertility. 181  The late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a reversal of the declining trajectory of the rate of mortality in the USSR, and was especially notable among men of working age, but was also prevalent in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country. 182  An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again. 183  The infant mortality rate increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise as mostly real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services. 184  The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed, and researchers could delve into the real causes. 185  Women and fertility Valentina Tereshkova , the first woman in space, visiting the Lviv confectionery, Ukrainian SSR, 1967 Under Lenin, the state made explicit commitments to promote the equality of men and women. Many early Russian feminists and ordinary Russian working women actively participated in the Revolution, and many more were affected by the events of that period and the new policies. Beginning in October 1918, the Lenins government liberalized divorce and abortion laws, decriminalized homosexuality, permitted cohabitation, and ushered in a host of reforms. 186  However, without birth control , the new system produced many broken marriages, as well as countless out-of-wedlock children. 187  The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy. Giving women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate, perceived as a threat to their countrys military power. By 1936, Stalin reversed most of the liberal laws, ushering in a pronatalist era that lasted for decades. 188  By 1917, Russia became the first great power to grant women the right to vote. 189  After heavy casualties in World War I and II, women outnumbered men in Russia by a 43 ratio. 190  This contributed to the larger role women played in Russian society compared to other great powers at the time. Education Main article Education in the Soviet Union Young Pioneers at a Young Pioneer camp in Kazakh SSR Anatoly Lunacharsky became the first Peoples Commissar for Education of Soviet Russia. In the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy . All left-handed kids were forced to write with their right hand in the Soviet school system. 191  192  193  194  Literate people were automatically hired as teachers.  citation needed  For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity. By 1940, Stalin could announce that illiteracy had been eliminated. Throughout the 1930s, social mobility rose sharply, which has been attributed to reforms in education. 195  In the aftermath of World War II, the countrys educational system expanded dramatically, which had a tremendous effect. In the 1960s, nearly all children had access to education, the only exception being those living in remote areas. Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society. Education also became important in giving rise to the New Man . 196  Citizens directly entering the workforce had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training . The education system was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness . However, as part of the general antisemitic policy , an unofficial Jewish quota was applied  when  in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations. 197  198  199  200  The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary. 201  According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the US. 202  Nationalities and ethnic groups Main articles Islam in the Soviet Union , National delimitation in the Soviet Union , Korenizatsiya , and Soviet Central Asia People in Samarkand , Uzbek SSR, 1981 Svaneti man in Mestia , Georgian SSR, 1929 The Soviet Union was an ethnically diverse country, with more than 100 distinct ethnic groups. The total population was estimated at 293 million in 1991. According to a 1990 estimate, the majority were Russians 50.78, followed by Ukrainians 15.45 and Uzbeks 5.84. 203  All citizens of the USSR had their own ethnic affiliation. The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen 204  by the childs parents. If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father. Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia , who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians . 205  Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force. Russians, Belarusians , and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not. With multiple nationalities living in the same territory, ethnic antagonisms developed over the years. 206   neutrality is disputed  Members of various ethnicities participated in the legislative bodies of the Soviet Union. Organs of power like the Politburo, the Secretariat of the Central Committee etc., were formally ethnically neutral, but in reality, ethnic Russians were overrepresented, although there were also non-Russian leaders in the Soviet leadership , such as Joseph Stalin , Grigory Zinoviev , Nikolai Podgorny or Andrei Gromyko . During the Soviet era, a significant number of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians migrated to other Soviet republics, and many of them settled there. According to the last census in 1989, the Russian diaspora in the Soviet republics had reached 25 million. 207  Ethnographic map of the Soviet Union, 1941 Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the RSFSR  1926 census  Number and share of Ukrainians in the population of the regions of the RSFSR 1979 census Map showing the distribution of Muslims within the Soviet Union in 1979 Health Main article Health care in the Soviet Union An early Soviet-era poster discouraging unsafe abortion practices In 1917, before the revolution, health conditions were significantly behind those of developed countries. As Lenin later noted, Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice. 208  The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the Peoples Commissariat for Health in 1918. Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, a revolutionary concept at the time. Article 42 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution gave all citizens the right to health protection and free access to any health institutions in the USSR. Before Leonid Brezhnev became General Secretary, the Sovet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists. This changed, however, from Brezhnevs accession and Mikhail Gorbachev s tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision. 209  Minister of Health Yevgeniy Chazov , during the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , while highlighting such successes as having the most doctors and hospitals in the world, recognized the systems areas for improvement and felt that billions of Soviet rubles were squandered. 210  After the revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up. This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system . These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States. Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of alcohol abuse . At the same time, infant mortality began to rise. After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter. This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union. 211  Language Main article Languages of the Soviet Union Under Lenin, the government gave small language groups their own writing systems. 212  The development of these writing systems was highly successful, even though some flaws were detected. During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies. A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other. 213  When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, it would attain official language status. There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system therefore, their speakers were forced to have a second language . 214  There are examples where the government retreated from this policy, most notably under Stalin where education was discontinued in languages that were not widespread. These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian. 215  During World War II, some minority languages were banned, and their speakers accused of collaborating with the enemy. 216  As the most widely spoken of the Soviet Unions many languages, Russian de facto functioned as an official language, as the language of interethnic communication Russian    , but only assumed the de jure status as the official national language in 1990. 217  Religion Main article Religion in the Soviet Union The Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow during its demolition in 1931 A hijab burning ceremony in the Uzbek SSR as part of Soviet Hujum policies . Christianity and Islam had the highest number of adherents among the religious citizens. 218  Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russias traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the largest Christian denomination . About 90 of the Soviet Unions Muslims were Sunnis , with Shias being concentrated in the Azerbaijan SSR . 218  Smaller groups included Roman Catholics , Jews , Buddhists , and a variety of Protestant denominations especially Baptists and Lutherans . 218  Religious influence had been strong in the Russian Empire. The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy, and took part in carrying out official state functions. 219  The immediate period following the establishment of the Soviet state included a struggle against the Orthodox Church, which the revolutionaries considered an ally of the former ruling classes . 220  In Soviet law, the freedom to hold religious services was constitutionally guaranteed, although the ruling Communist Party regarded religion as incompatible with the Marxist spirit of scientific materialism . 220  In practice, the Soviet system subscribed to a narrow interpretation of this right, and in fact utilized a range of official measures to discourage religion and curb the activities of religious groups. 220  The 1918 Council of Peoples Commissars decree establishing the Russian SFSR as a secular state also decreed that the teaching of religion in all places where subjects of general instruction are taught, is forbidden. Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately. 221  Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929 included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study . 220  Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s. By 1940, as many as 90 of the churches, synagogues, and mosques that had been operating in 1917 were closed. 222  Soviet stamp showing Saint Sophias Cathedral, Kiev and statue of Bohdan Khmelnytsky , 1989 Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past with most Soviet Christians, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s. 223  Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during World War II. Amid other accommodations to religious faith after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, churches were reopened. Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943. Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the Soviet Union even through the late 1980s. 223  The general tendency of this period was an increase in religious activity among believers of all faiths. 224  Under Nikita Khrushchev , the state leadership clashed with the churches in 19581964, a period when atheism was emphasized in the educational curriculum, and numerous state publications promoted atheistic views. 223  During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97. 225  The number of working mosques also declined, falling from 1,500 to 500 within a decade. 225  Religious institutions remained monitored by the Soviet government, but churches, synagogues, temples, and mosques were all given more leeway in the Brezhnev era . 226  Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour . 227  A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20 of the Soviet population as active religious believers. 228  Military Main article Soviet Armed Forces See also Red Army , Soviet Navy , Soviet Air Forces , and Military history of the Soviet Union This section is empty.

During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art. Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people. On the other hand, hundreds of intellectuals, writers, and artists were exiled or executed, and their work banned, such as Nikolay Gumilyov who was shot for alleged conspiring against the Bolshevik regime, and Yevgeny Zamyatin . 229  The government encouraged a variety of trends. In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated. Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time. As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director Sergei Eisenstein s best work dates from this period. During Stalins rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of socialist realism , with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as Mikhail Bulgakov s works. Many writers were imprisoned and killed. 230  Following the Khrushchev Thaw , censorship was diminished. During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life. Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work. The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism. Underground dissident literature, known as samizdat , developed during this late period. In architecture, the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalins epoch. In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachevs policies of perestroika and glasnost significantly expanded freedom of expression throughout the country in the media and the press. 231  Sport See also Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union , CSKA Moscow , Soviet Union at the Olympics , and Soviet Union mens national ice hockey team Valeri Kharlamov represented the Soviet Union at 11 Ice Hockey World Championships , winning 8 gold medals, 2 silvers and 1 bronze. Founded on 20 July 1924 in Moscow, Sovetsky Sport was the first sports newspaper of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Olympic Committee formed on 21 April 1951, and the IOC recognized the new body in its 45th session . In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement . The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes. The Soviet Union national ice hockey team won nearly every world championship and Olympic tournament between 1954 and 1991 and never failed to medal in any International Ice Hockey Federation IIHF tournament in which they competed. The advent  when  of the state-sponsored full-time amateur athlete of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession  in reality, the state paid many of these competitors to train on a full-time basis. 232  Nevertheless, the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism. 233  A 1989 report by a committee of the Australian Senate claimed that there is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner...who is not on one sort of drug or another usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might well have been called the Chemists Games. 234  A member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to epitestosterone in urine . Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists, would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official. The results of Donikes unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols. 235  The first documented case of  blood doping  occurred at the 1980 Summer Olympics when a runner  who  was transfused with two pints of blood before winning medals in the 5000  m and 10,000  m. 236  Documentation obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Unions plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated before the USSRs decision to boycott the 1984 Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture prepared the communication, directed to the Soviet Unions head of track and field. Portugalov later became one of the leading figures involved in the implementation of Russian doping before the 2016 Summer Olympics. 237  See also Soviet Union portal Communism portal Russia portal Collective Security Treaty Organization Commonwealth of Independent States Communism Dissolution of the Soviet Union Eurasian Economic Union Ideocracy Index of Soviet Union-related articles Neo-Sovietism Orphans in the Soviet Union Soviet Empire FranceRussia relationsUSSR 1918-1991 Conflicts Cold War Operation Barbarossa Russian Civil War Soviet Invasion of Poland Sino-Soviet split Sino-Soviet border clashes Nationalities Baltic states under Soviet rule 194491 Islam in the Soviet Union Soviet people Korenizatsiya Ukrainian nationalism Soviet Central Asia Notes  Russian    , tr.

Snyder claims that archival evidence suggests maximum excess mortality of nine million during the entire Stalin era. 39  Historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft asserts that around a million purposive killings can be attributed to Stalinist regime, along with the premature deaths of roughly two million more amongst the repressed populations i.e., in camps, prisons, exile, etc. through criminal negligence. 40   Ukrainian    rada  Polish  rada  Belarusian    Uzbek    Kazakh    Georgian    Azerbaijani    Lithuanian  taryba  Moldovan    Latvian  padome  Kyrgyz    Tajik    Armenian      Turkmen    Estonian  nukogu References  De facto before 1990  ARTICLE 124 .

The new evidence shows that administrative command planning and Stalins forced industrialization strategies failed in the 1930s and beyond. The economic miracle chronicled in official hagiographies and until recently faithfully recounted in Western textbooks has no basis in fact. It is the statistical artefact not of index number relativity the Gerschenkron effect but of misapplying to the calculation of growth cost prices that do not accurately measure competitive value. The standard of living declined during the 1930s in response to Stalins despotism, and after a brief improvement following his death, lapsed into stagnation. Glasnost and post-communist revelations interpreted as a whole thus provide no basis for Getty, Rittersporn  Zemskovs relatively favorable characterization of the methods, economic achievements and human costs of Stalinism. The evidence demonstrates that the suppression of markets and the oppression of vast segments of the population were economically counterproductive and humanly calamitous, just as anyone conversant with classical economic theory should have expected.

The document  obtained by The New York Times from a former chief medical doctor for Soviet track and field  was signed by Dr. Sergei Portugalov, a Soviet sports doctor who went on to capitalize on a growing interest in new methods of doping. ... Now, more than 30 years later, Dr. Portugalov is a central figure in Russias current doping scandal. Last fall, the World Anti-Doping Agency named him as a key broker of performance-enhancing drugs in Russia, someone who in recent years injected athletes personally and made a business of covering up drug violations in exchange for money. ... Dr. Portugalov came to global prominence in 2014 when two Russian whistle-blowers identified him as a linchpin distributor in Russias state-run doping scheme.
