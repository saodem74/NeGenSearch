Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product GDP, gross national product GNP, the per capita income , level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living. 2  Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. Developed countries have generally post-industrial economies, meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector . They are contrasted with developing countries , which are in the process of industrialisation or are pre-industrial and almost entirely agrarian , some of which might fall into the category of Least Developed Countries . As of 2015, advanced economies comprise 60.8 of global GDP based on nominal values and 42.9 of global GDP based on purchasing-power parity PPP according to the International Monetary Fund . 3  In 2017, the ten largest advanced economies by GDP in both nominal and PPP terms were Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , South Korea , Spain , the United Kingdom , and the United States . 4  Contents 1 Similar terms 2 Definition and criteria 3 Human Development Index HDI 4 High-income economies 4.1 World Bank high-income economies 4.2 High-income OECD members 5 Development Assistance Committee members 6 IMF advanced economies 7 Paris Club members 8 Comparative Table 2019 9 Rankings 10 See also 11 Notes 12 References 13 External links Similar terms  edit  See also NorthSouth divide Terms linked to the concept developed country include advanced country, industrialized country, more developed country MDC, more economically developed country MEDC,  Global North country,  first world country, and post-industrial country. The term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous, as industrialisation is an ongoing process that is hard to define. The first industrialized country was the United Kingdom , followed by Belgium. Later it spread further to Germany , United States , France and other Western European countries . According to some economists such as Jeffrey Sachs , however, the current divide between the developed and developing world is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century. 5  Definition and criteria  edit  Countries by 2018 GDP nominal per capita 6  Economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions. One such criterion is income per capita countries with high gross domestic product GDP per capita would thus be described as developed countries. Another economic criterion is industrialisation  countries in which the tertiary and quaternary sectors of industry dominate would thus be described as developed. More recently another measure, the Human Development Index HDI, which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high HDI rating. The index, however, does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries, such as the G7 members and others. 7  8  According to the United Nations Statistics Division  There is no established convention for the designation of developed and developing countries or areas in the United Nations system. 9  And it notes that The designations developed and developing are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process. 10  Human Development Index HDI  edit  Main articles Human Development Index and List of countries by Human Development Index The UN HDI is a statistical measure that gauges a countrys level of human development. While there is a strong correlation between having a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, the UN points out that the HDI accounts for more than income or productivity. Unlike GDP per capita or per capita income, the HDI takes into account how income is turned into education and health opportunities and therefore into higher levels of human development. Since 1990, Norway 20012006, 20092017, Japan 19901991 and 1993, Canada 1992 and 19942000 and Iceland 20072008 have had the highest HDI score. Many countries listed by IMF as advanced, possess an HDI over 0.800, the threshold for very high human development. Many countries Note 1  possessing an HDI of 0.800 and over are also listed by IMF as advanced. Thus, many advanced economies are characterized by an HDI score of 0.800 or higher. Since April 2016, the IMF classifies Macau as an advanced economy. 11  The 2018 Human Development Report by the United Nations Development Programme was released on 14 September 2018, and calculates HDI values based on estimates for 2017.  citation needed  Below is the list of the very high human development countries 12   increase.  steady.  decrease.

Additionally, while the HDI for the Chinese special administrative region of Hong Kong is calculated by the UN, it is not for Macau . The Macanese government calculated the territorys HDI to be 0.868 in 2011. These values place both Taiwan and Macau well within the list of countries with Very high human development. 14  Furthermore, in 2009 a United Nations project calculated the HDI for all of its members, as well as Taiwan, Macau, and many dependent territories . The HDI values for the countries of San Marino and Monaco , which have not been included in official annual HDI reports, were found to be at 0.961 and 0.956 respectively. This places both countries firmly within the category of countries with Very high human development as well. The dependent territories with HDI values equivalent to Very high human development were Jersey , Cayman Islands , Bermuda , Guernsey , Gibraltar , Norfolk Island , Faroe Islands , Isle of Man , British Virgin Islands , Falkland Islands , Aruba , Puerto Rico , Martinique , Greenland , and Guam . 15  Of note, the HDI values in the 2009 report were calculated using the old HDI formula, while HDI values after the year 2010 are calculated with a different formula. High-income economies  edit  Some institutions have produced lists of developed countries the UN list shown above, the CIA, 16  and some providers of stock market indices the FTSE Group , MSCI , S P , Dow Jones , STOXX , etc.. The latter is not included here because its association of developed countries with countries with both high incomes and developed markets is not deemed as directly relevant.  why  Note 2  However many other institutions have created more general lists referred to when discussing developed countries. For example, the International Monetary Fund IMF identifies 39 advanced economies. 11  17  The OECD s 36 members are known as the developed countries club 18  19  20  The World Bank identifies 81 high income countries. 21  World Bank high-income economies  edit  Main articles World Bank high-income economy and List of countries by GNI nominal, Atlas method per capita World Bank high-income economies in 2019 According to the World Bank the following 81 countries including territories are classified as high-income economies. 21  As of 2018, high-income economies are those that had a GNI per capita of 12,056 or more  in 2017. 36 countries and territories wholly or partly in Europe    Andorra   Austria   Belgium Channel Islands   Croatia   Cyprus   Czech Republic   Denmark   Estonia   Faroe Islands   Finland   France   Germany   Gibraltar   Greece   Hungary   Iceland   Ireland   Isle of Man   Italy   Liechtenstein   Latvia   Lithuania   Luxembourg   Malta   Monaco   Netherlands   Norway   Poland   Portugal   San Marino   Slovakia   Slovenia   Spain   Sweden     Switzerland   United Kingdom 19 countries and territories wholly or partly in North America    Antigua and Barbuda   Aruba   Bahamas   Barbados   Bermuda   British Virgin Islands   Canada   Cayman Islands   Curaao c   Greenland   Panama   Puerto Rico   Saint Martin   Sint Maarten c   Saint Kitts and Nevis   Turks and Caicos Islands   Trinidad and Tobago   United States   U.S. Virgin Islands 15 countries and territories wholly or partly in Asia    Bahrain   Brunei   Hong Kong   Israel   Japan   Kuwait   Macau   Oman   Qatar   Saudi Arabia   Singapore   South Korea   Taiwan   United Arab Emirates 7 countries and territories wholly or partly in Oceania    Australia   French Polynesia   Guam   New Caledonia   New Zealand   Northern Mariana Islands   Palau 2 countries wholly or partly in South America    Chile   Uruguay 1 country wholly or partly in Africa    Seychelles c Between 1994 and 2009, as part of the   Netherlands Antilles .
