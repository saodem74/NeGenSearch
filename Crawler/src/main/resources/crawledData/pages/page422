In September 2005, both institutions held votes of the merger and the members voted in favour 73.5 IEE, 95.7 IIE. This merger also needed government approval, so a petition was then made to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom for a Supplemental Charter, to allow the creation of the new institution. This was approved by the Privy Council on December 14, 2005, and the new institution emerged on March 31, 2006. History of the IEE  edit  Main article Institution of Electrical Engineers The Society of Telegraph Engineers STE was formed on May 17, 1871, and it published the Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers from 1872 through 1880. Carl Wilhelm Siemens was first President of IEE in 1872. On December 22, 1880, the STE was renamed as the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians and, as part of this change, it renamed its journal the Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers and of Electricians 1881  82 and later the Journal of the Society of Telegraph-Engineers and Electricians 1883  88. Following a meeting of its Council on 10 November 1887, it was decided to adopt the name of the Institution of Electrical Engineers IEE. The name of the Institution of Electrical Engineers remains engraved in the marble faade of its headquarters at Savoy Place. As part of this change, its Journal was renamed Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1889, and it kept this title through 1963. In 1921, the Institution was Incorporated by royal charter and, following mergers with the Institution of Electronic and Radio Engineers IERE in 1988 and the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers IMfgE in 1990, it had a worldwide membership of around 120,000. The IEE represented the engineering profession, operated Professiona l Networks worldwide groups of engineers sharing common technical and professional interests, had an educational role including the accreditation of degree courses and operated schemes to provide awards scholarships, grants and prizes. It was well known for publication of the IEE Wiring Regulations which now continue to be written by the IET and to be published by the British Standards Institution as BS 7671 . The IET hosts the archive for the Womens Engineering Society WES and it has also provided office space for WES since 2005. History of the IIE  edit  Main article Institution of Incorporated Engineers The modern Institution of Incorporated Engineers IIE traced its heritage to The Vulcanic Society that was founded in 1884 and became the Junior Institution of Engineers in 1902, which became the Institution of General Technician Engineers in 1970. It changed its name in 1976 to the Institution of Mechanical and General Technician Engineers. At this point it merged with the Institution of Technician Engineers in Mechanical Engineering and formed the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers in 1988. The Institution of Engineers in Charge, which was founded in 1895, was merged into the Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers IMechIE in 1990. The Institution of Electrical and Electronic Technician Engineers, the Society of Electronic and Radio Technicians, and the Institute of Practitioners in Radio and Electronics merged in 1990 to form the Institution of Electronics and Electrical Incorporated Engineers IEEIE. The IIE was formed in April 1998 by the merger of The Institution of Electronic and Electrical Incorporated Engineers IEEIE, The Institution of Mechanical Incorporated Engineers IMechIE, and The Institute of Engineers and Technicians IET, not to be confused with the later-formed Institution of Engineering and Technology. In 1999 there was a further merger with The Institu tion of Incorporated Executive Engineers IIExE. The IIE had a worldwide membership of approximately 40,000. History of the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers  edit  The Institution of Manufacturing Engineers IMfgE, formerly the Institution of Production Engineers IProdE, was founded following the initiative of one H. E. Honer who wrote to a technical periodical titled Engineering Production suggesting that the time was ripe to form an institution for the specialised interests of engineers engaged in manufacture. As a result of corres pondence generated by this letter a meeting was held at Cannon Street Hotel in London on 26 February 1921. At this meeting it was decided to form the IProdE in order to establish the status and designation of production or manufacturing engineers to promote the science of practical production in industry and to facilitate the interchange of ideas between engineers, manufactu rers and other specialists. The term production engineering came into use to describe the management of factory production techniques first developed by Henry Ford, which had expanded greatly during the First World War. The IProdE was incorporated in 1931 and was granted its armorial bearings in 1937. From the outset the Institution operated through decentralised branches cal led local sections wherever a sufficient number of members existed. These local sections were self-governing and elected their own officers. Local sections held monthly meetings at which papers were read and discussed. Outstanding papers were published in the Institutions journal. Named papers commemorating the work of the following eminent production engineers were read at na tional meetings Viscount Nuffield, Sir Alfred Herbert, Colonel George Bray, Lord Sempill, E. H. Hancock, and J. N. Kirby. National and regional conferences were also arranged dealing with specific industrial problems. Active councils were gradually established worldwide including in Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and South Africa. The Institutions education committee established a graduate examination which all junior entrants undertook from 1932 onwards. An examination for Associate Membership was introduced in 1951. The Second World War further accelerated developments in production engineering and by 1945 membership of the IProdE stood at 5,000. The 1950s and 1960s were perhaps the most fruitful period for the Institution. Major conferen ces such as The Automatic Factory in 1955 ensured that the Institution held a place at the forefront of production technology. A Royal Charter was granted in 1964 and membership stood at over 17,000 by 1969. In 1981 the IProdE instituted four medals as part of its Diamond Jubilee celebrations comprising the International Award, the Mensforth Gold Medal, the Nuffield Award an d the Silver Medal. The Mensforth Gold Medal was named after Sir Eric Mensforth, founder and chairman of Westland Helicopters and a former IProdE President. The medal was awarded to British recipients who had made an outstanding contribution to the advancement of production engineering technology. Today the Mensforth Manufacturing Gold Medal is the IETs premier manufacturing a ward. Financial constraints, a slowing in membership and a blurring of distinctions between the various branches of engineering led the IProdE to merger proposals in the late 1980s. The Institution of Electrical Engineers IEE had interests very close to those of the IProdE. The IEE was a much larger organisation than the IProdE and the proposal was that the IProdE should be r epresented as a specialist division within the IEE. While these talks were reaching fruition in 1991 the IProdE changed its name to the Institution of Manufacturing Engineers. A merger with the IEE took place the same year, with the IMfgE becoming the IEEs new Manufacturing Division. 4  IET Presidents  edit  The IET is governed by the President, the CEO, and Board of Trustees 5  . The IET Council, 6  on the other hand, serves as the advisory and consultative body, representing views of the members at large and offering advice to the Board of Trustees. Since founding the IET, several prominent engineers 7  have served as its President and the recent Presidents are listed below 2018 Mr Michael Douglas Carr 2017 Mr Nick Winser CBE FREng BSc 2016 Jeremy Daniel McK Watson CBE FREng MSc DPhil 2015 Naomi Climer FREng BSc 2014 William Timothy Webb FREng BEng MBA PhD 2013 Commodore Barry P.S.
