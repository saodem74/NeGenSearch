Like the foundations of all fields, this is disputed by some and is continually being questioned, but this is a definite minority position. Second, the paper by Moschovakis appears to be a bad cite to support this idea. That paper discusses whether Turing machines capture computational efficiency correctly at the level of specific polynomials. But this is very different than suggesting that they dont capture computability . Jess_Riedel  talk  1212, 24 March 2018 UTC That is all correct, but I dont think it is what the quote was getting at. I dont think anybody argues that the definition of an algorithm is a Turing machine. Somehow, algorithms are courser than Turing machines - two different Turing machines can implement the same algorithm. Indeed this is visible even in the abstract of the reference that was given before 1 , and if you open the cached article the first page says the same thing.   Carl  CBM     talk  1253, 24 March 2018 UTC Similarly, Knuth 1977 writes A program is the statement of an algorithm in some well defined language. Thus a computer program represents an algorithm, although the algorithm itself is a mental concept that exists independently of any representation. The challenge that this article was referring to is how to define that mental concept - an algorithm - in a way that does no t identify it with a particular program.   Carl  CBM     talk  1301, 24 March 2018 UTC Media usage  edit  Very recently, I have noticed an increasing tendency for journalists and commentators to used the word algorithm to refer to automated classifiers constructed by applying machine-learning techniques to big data. So we hear that government agencies are using algorithms to identify benefit cheats, for example. Of course the resulting classifier is not an algorithm, because the procedures it follows cannot be specified - these classifiers are black boxes. I fear that the word is losing its unambiguous specification sense, because these media types think it makes them look clever to be using such a big, technical-sounding word. Is it worth emphasising that distinction in this article Like King Canute we cant hold the tide back, but we can at least plant a stick in the sand to show where high-tide used to be, no MrDemeanour  talk  0919, 17 September 2018 UTC Legal Issues  edit  The first paragraph of this section smells strongly of WPOR , and is entirely unsourced. The section on Legal Issues currently relies on two sources the first is an article in a law journal by a researcher Andrew Tutt who is not sufficiently notable to have his own wikipedia article. The first two pages of a google search for Andrew Tutt generates a lot of stuff about a cancer specialist in London a few pages about US lawyers, none of whom appear to be resea rchers and a dead cricket player. Tutts opinion that a we need a new US regulatory agency for algorithms is arrant nonsense, and should be deleted as WPBOLLOCKS . As it happens, some algorithms are not even within US regulatory jurisdiction, believe it or not The second source is a document published by the Web Foundation, that goes out of its way to point out that it relies on a definition of algorithm very different from the one we are using it then declines to give any proper definition of the word, just noting To avoid confusion, this paper employs a systems definition of algorithm, describing code and data as well as th e greater socio-technical assemblage that includes algorithm, model, target goal, data, training data, application, hardware - and connect it all to a broader social endeavour. What To avoid confusion That isnt even grammatical and much of the rest of the paper contains basic grammar mistakes, which to my mind bespeak an inability to string two thoughts together coherently. The material based on Tutt is evidently relying on a definition of algorithm similar to the one the Web Foundation appears to be using, a definition that doesnt seem to include the words unambiguous specification. I think the entire section should be removed from the article this article is about algorithms as well-defined procedures, not as socio-technical assemblages that can be overseen, held accountable etc. I propose to perform this deletion within a few hours. I think this section detracts from what is otherwise a pretty good article but see my separate comment on History. There might be an argument for including a brief paragraph noting the recent tendency to use the word to refer to any automated process, however complex or opaque. I do not want to write that paragraph. MrDemeanour  talk  1044, 17 September 2018 UTC I deleted the Tutt and Web Foundation stuff. I left stuff about patents and export bans that stuff needs citing, and needs to be made more specific about e.g. which jurisdictions impose crypto export bans some people reading this may not be in a jurisdiction that enforces US patent law or that defines crypto as weaponry. MrDemeanour  talk  1656, 17 September 2018 UTC History Development of the notion of algorithm  edit  Given the definition we are relying on in the lede, algorithms have been in use for as long as humans have been engaged in reasoning. This section implies that algorithms began with the ancient Greeks. The section then starts burrowing into the history of automation and computing, perpetuating the incorrect belief that an algorithm is any procedure followed by a machine. This is followed by a discussion of 19th C developments in symbolic logic, which seems to me off-topic. The History section is quite a long section I think it goes way too far back in time. We say in the lede A partial formalization of what would become the modern notion of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem the decision problem posed by David Hilbert in 1928. I agree. But if thats where the notion began, then a section on the history of t he notion of algorithm should not start with the ancient Greeks. Change the section title, maybe I dont really want to try to fix these problems I see in the history section, because, well, deleting loads of stuff tends to upset people. But if enough people agree with me, then I might have a go. MrDemeanour  talk  1044, 17 September 2018 UTC Nit on reference in section on Mechanical contrivances with discrete states. It starts with The clock Bolter credits the invention of the weight-driven clock as The key invention of Europe in the Middle Ages, in particular, the verge escapement73 This not an idea original to Bolter, it clearly comes from Lewis Mumfords Technics and Civilization 1934 and given tha t key invention is Mumfords phrase, I would guess that Bolter did not seek credit for the idea, he even quotes Mumford elsewhere.   Preceding unsigned comment added by Leo Schlosberg  talk  contribs  2218, 29 April 2019 UTC Computational methods, algorithms and the Halting Problem  edit  In the lead we follow Knuths definitions and say that the algorithm must compute an outcome in finite steps and we distinguish between an algorithm and a computational method. In the opening paragraph of the Informal definition section we say that Generally, a program is only an algorithm if it stops eventually citing Stone. Then the section of Formalization in which we show that the prevailing academic opinion is is that the set of algorithms corresponds to the set of Turing machines through some apropriate transformation. Since we have a Formalization section and mention Turing Machines I believe it is important to mention that the definition of algorithms that requires finiteness means that we cannot tell wether a proceedure is an algorithm in the general case because of the Halting Problem. Which makes this kind of definition impractical, in the general case again. Ofcourse, talking about well-defined processes whose termination is provably impossible to be determined is bewildering. It was bewildering among mathematicians in the times it was discovered. Maybe thats why algorithms are so difficult to conceptualize after all. My quetion is Mentioning the impossibility of distinguishing between algorithms and computational methods if we follow Knuth, Stone and the informal definitions in general is helpful or not helpful I believe it is necessecary. Then again, it may not benefit the reader. It would be great if we found a way to put this mildly, withouth shocking anyone. Nxavar  talk  1852, 30 July 2019 UTC The relation of the Halting Problem to the informal definitions of the algorithm was just added to the main body.
