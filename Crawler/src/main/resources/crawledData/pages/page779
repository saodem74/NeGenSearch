Address programming language From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Not to be confused with APL  A P rogramming L anguage . The Address programming language  Russian     Ukrainian      is one of the worlds first high-level programming languages . 1  It was created in 1955 by Kateryna Yushchenko . 2  In particular, the Address programming language made possible indirect addressing and addresses of the highest rank    analogous to pointers . Unlike Fortran and ALGOL 60 , APL Address programming language supported indirect addressing and addressing of higher ranks. Indirect addressing is a mechanism that appeared in other programming languages much later 196365    in PL1 . The Address language was implemented on all the computers of the first and second generation produced in the Soviet Union. The Address language influenced the architecture of the Kyiv, Strela, Ural, and Promin computers. The Address was used exclusively for the solution of economical problems, including aviation, space exploration, machine building, and military complex    in particular, to calculate the trajectories of ballistic missiles in flight    in the 195060s. Implementations of the Address programming language were used for nearly 20 years. A book about APL was written in 1967 and it was translated into French and published in France in 1974. The Address language affected not only the Soviet Unions economical development, but information technology and programming. APLs proposed and implemented ideas and tools can be found in many programming-related fields, such as abstract data types, object-oriented programming, functional programming, database and artificial intelligence.
