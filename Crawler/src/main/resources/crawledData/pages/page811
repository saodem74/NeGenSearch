It was created in 1967 through the federation of two longstanding contiguous institutions Western Reserve University, founded in 1826 and named for its location in the Connecticut Western Reserve , and Case Institute of Technology, founded in 1880 through the endowment of Leonard Case, Jr. . Time magazine described the merger as the creation of Clevelands Big-Leaguer university. 7  Seventeen Nobel laureates have been previously affiliated with Case Western Reserve or one of its two predecessors. 8  In U.S. News  World Report  s 2019 rankings, Case Western Reserve was ranked as tied for 42nd among national universities and 152nd among global universities. 9  10  The 2019 edition of The Wall Street Journal  Times Higher Education WSJTHE rankings ranked Case Western Reserve as tied for 39th among US colleges and universities. 11  The campus is approximately 5 miles 8  km east of Downtown Cleveland in the neighborhood known as University Circle , an area encompassing 550 acres 220 ha  containing a concentration of educational, medical, and cultural institutions. 12  Case Western Reserve has a number of programs taught in conjunction with University Circle institutions, including the Cleveland Clinic , the University Hospitals of Cleveland , the Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Cleveland Institute of Music , the Cleveland Hearing  Speech Center , the Cleveland Museum of Art , the Cleveland Institute of Art , the Cleveland Museum of Natural History , and the Cleveland Play House . Severance Hall , home of the Cleveland Orchestra , resides on Case Western Reserve campus. Case Western Reserve includes the medical school , business school , dental school , law school , Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing named for former U.S. Representative Frances P. Bolton , Department of Biomedical Engineering and its biomedical teaching and research capabilities. Case Western Reserve is a member of the Association of American Universities . 13  Case is an institution concentrating on research in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering . The MichelsonMorley interferometer experiment was conducted in 1887 in the basement of a campus dormitory by Albert A. Michelson of Case School of Applied Science and Edward W. Morley of Western Reserve University. This experiment proved the non-existence of the luminiferous ether and was later understood as evidence in support of special relativity as proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905. Michelson became the first American to win a Nobel Prize in science. 14  The commemorative Michelson-Morley Memorial Fountain as well as an Ohio Historical Marker are located on campus, near where the actual experiment was performed.

Western Reserve College 18261882 and University 18821967  edit  John J.R. Macleod , 1923 Nobel Prize winner for discovering Insulin and Western Reserve University Professor of Physiology. Western Reserve College, the college of the Connecticut Western Reserve , was founded in 1826 in Hudson, Ohio , as the Western Reserve College and Preparatory School . Western Reserve College, or Reserve as it was popularly called, was the first college in northern Ohio. 15  The school was called Yale of the West its campus, now that of the Western Reserve Academy , imitated that of Yale. It had the same motto, Lux et Veritas Light and Truth, the same entrance standards, and almost the same curriculum. The vision its founders had of Western Reserve College was that it would instill in students an evangelical ethos, and produce ministers to remedy the acute shortage of them in Ohio. Liberal arts and sciences were important, but secondary. The college was located in Hudson because the town made the largest financial offer to help in its construction. 16   422 Hudson was a quiet antislavery center from the beginning its founder, David Hudson , was against slavery. It was a major stop on the Underground Railroad . The abolitionist John Brown , who would lead the 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry , grew up in Hudson. Along with Presbyterian influences of its founding, the schools origins were strongly associated with the pre- Civil War Abolitionist movement, 17  primarily due to the influence of President Charles Backus Storrs , Elizur Wright , and David Hudson. In fact, Western Reserve was the first college west of the Appalachian Mountains to enroll 1832 and graduate 1836 an African-American student, John Sykes Fayette. 18  The abolitionist views were so strong, Frederick Douglass gave the commencement speech in 1854. 19  In 1838, the Loomis Observatory was built by astronomer Elias Loomis , and today remains the second oldest observatory in the United States . 20  In 1852, the Medical School became the second medical school in the United States to graduate a woman, Nancy Talbot Clark . Five more women graduated over the next four years, including Emily Blackwell and Marie Zakrzewska , giving Western Reserve the distinction of graduating six of the first eight female physicians in the United States . 21  By 1875, Cleveland had emerged as the dominant population and business center of the area, and the city wanted a prominent higher education institution. In 1882, with funding from Amasa Stone , Western Reserve College moved to Cleveland and changed its name to Adelbert College of Western Reserve University. Adelbert was the name of Stones son. 22  Case School of Applied Science 18801947 and Institute of Technology 19471967  edit  Case alumnus Herbert Henry Dow , founder of Dow Chemical . In 1877, Leonard Case Jr. began laying the groundwork for the Case School of Applied Science by secretly donating valuable pieces of Cleveland real estate to a trust. He asked his confidential advisor, Henry Gilbert Abbey, to administer the trust and to keep it secret until after his death in 1880. On March 29, 1880, articles of incorporation were filed for the founding of the Case School of Applied Science . Classes began on September 15, 1881. 23  The school received its charter by the state of Ohio in 1882. For the first four years of the schools existence, it was located in the Case familys home on Rockwell Street in downtown Cleveland . Classes were held in the family house, while the chemistry and physics laboratories were on the second floor of the barn. Amasa Stone s gift to relocate Western Reserve College to Cleveland also included a provision for the purchase of land in the University Circle area, adjacent to Western Reserve University, for the Case School of Applied Science. The school relocated to University Circle in 1885. During World War II , Case School of Applied Science was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. 24  Over time, the Case School of Applied Science expanded to encompass broader subjects, adopting the name Case Institute of Technology in 1947 to reflect the institutions growth. 22  Led by polymer expert Eric Baer in 1963, the nations first stand-alone Polymer Science and Engineering program was founded, to eventually become the Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering. 25  Federation of two universities  edit  Although the trustees of Case Institute of Technology and Western Reserve University did not formally federate their institutions until 1967, the institutions already shared buildings and staff when necessary and worked together often. One such example was seen in 1887, when Case physicist Albert Michelson and Reserve chemist Edward Morley collaborated on the famous MichelsonMorley experiment . There had been some discussion of a merger of the two institutions as early as 1890, but those talks dissolved quickly. In the 1920s, the Survey Commission on Higher Education in Cleveland took a strong stand in favor of federation and the community was behind the idea as well, but in the end all that came of the study was a decision by the two institutions to cooperate in foun ding Cleveland College, a special unit for part-time and adult students in downtown Cleveland . By the 1960s, Reserve President John Schoff Millis and Case President T. Keith Glennan shared the idea that federation would create a complete university, one better able to attain national distinction. Financed by the Carnegie Corporation , Cleveland Foundation , Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation , and several local donors, a study commission of national leaders in higher education and public policy was charged with exploring the idea of federation. The Heald Commission, so known for its chair, former Ford Foundation President Henry T. Heald , issued its final report, Vision of a University. The report predicted that a federation could create one of the largest private universities in the nation. Case Western Reserve University 1967present  edit  In 1967, Case Institute of Technology, a school with its emphasis on engineering and science, and Western Reserve University, a school with professional programs and liberal arts, came together to form Case Western Reserve University. 26  In 1968, the Department of Biomedical Engineering launched as a newly unified collaboration between the School of Engineering and School of Medicine as the first in the nation and as one of the first Biomedical Engineering programs in the world. 27  The following year in 1969, the first Biomedical Engineering MDPhD program in the world began at Case Western Reserve. 28  The first computer engineering degree program in the United States was established in 1971 at Case Western Reserve. The Forward Thinking campaign was launched in 2011 by President Barbara Snyder to fundraise 1 billion, the largest in school history. The goal was reached in 2014 after 30 months. The Board of Trustees unanimously agreed to expand the campaign to 1.5 billion, which reached its mark a few years later in 2017. 29  Presidents  edit  See also List of Presidents of Case Western Reserve University President From Until Robert W.

In 2003, the university unveiled a new logo and branding campaign that emphasized the Case portion of its name. In 2006, interim university president Gregory Eastwood convened a task group to study reactions to the campaign. The panels report indicated that it had gone so poorly that, There appear to be serious concerns now about the universitys ability to recruit and maintain high-quality faculty, fund-raising and leadership. Also, the logo was derided among the universitys community and alumni and throughout northeastern Ohio critics said it looked like ...a fat man with a surfboard. 63  In 2007, the universitys board of trustees approved a shift back to giving equal weight to Case and Western Reserve. A new logo was chosen and implementation began July 1. 64  In an open letter to the university community, interim president Eastwood admitted that the university had misplaced its own history and traditions. 65  Student body  edit  As of August  2019 update  , the university had 5,150 undergraduate students and 6,674 graduate and professional students. 66  The undergraduate student body hails from all 50 states and approximately 81 countries. 67  Research  edit  Allen Memorial Medical Library .

Case Western Reserve pioneered the early Free-net computer systems, creating the first Free-net, The Cleveland Free-Net, as well as writing the software that drove a majority of those systems, known as FreePort. The Cleveland Free-Net was shut down in late 1999, as it had become obsolete. It was the first university to have an all-fiber-optic network, in 1989. 92  At the inaugural meeting in October, 1996, Case Western Reserve was one of the 34 charter university members of Internet2 . 93  The university was ranked No. 1 in Yahoo Internet Lifes 1999 Most Wired College list. 94  There was a perception that this award was obtained through partially false or inaccurate information submitted for the survey, 95  and the university did not appear at all on the 2000 Most Wired College list which included 100 institutions. The numbers reported were much lower than those submitted by Ray Neff in 1999. 96  97  The university had previously placed No. 13 in the 1997 poll. 98  In August 2003, Case Western Reserve joined the Internet Streaming Media Alliance , then one of only two university members. 99  In September 2003, Case Western Reserve opened 1,230 public wireless access points on the Case Western Reserve campus and University Circle. 100  Case Western Reserve was one of the founding members of OneCleveland, formed in October 2003. 101  OneCleveland is an ultra broadband gigabit speed fiber optic network.
