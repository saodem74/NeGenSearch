New participants are welcome please feel free to join Guide to WikiProjects Directory of WikiProjects Welcome to the WikiProject Computer science page. The goals of the project are to build a community of interest around computer science, and to provide a focal point for coordinating efforts to improve Wikipedias computer science articles. The scope of the project includes all articles in the area of computer science and computer programming in its broadest sense and may overlap with articles in areas such as mathematics , logic , and software engineering .

Audience  edit  One of the primary goals of this project is to make computer science articles accessible , so you should make an effort to explain any jargon . Conventions  edit  WikipediaWikiProject Computer scienceManual of style is a draft manual of style for CS articles. WikipediaManual of StyleMathematicsTypesetting of mathematical formulae describes how to typeset mathematical expressions WikipediaManual of StyleComputingCommand-line examples describes how sample shell commands should be formatted References  edit  Try to ensure that every computer science article includes at least a few relevant references, and direct citations for anything that could be considered controversial. Wikipedia articles cannot be a substitute for a textbook that is what Wikibooks is for, and references can give readers some idea of where they should go if they need more information than the article can provide. Just as important, providing further reading enables other editors to verify and to extend the given information, as well as to discuss the quality of a particular source. You can find more information on citations and references, as well as several examples for how the cited literature should look, in the style guide on citations . Wikipedias List of publications in computer science can be a good source of references and citations for computer science articles, as can Citeseer and Google Scholar .
