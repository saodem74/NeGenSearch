Infobox  references Polylactic acid or polylactide  PLA  is a thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable biomass, typically from fermented plant starch such as from corn , cassava , sugarcane or sugar beet pulp . In 2010, PLA had the second highest consumption volume of any bioplastic of the world. 3  The name polylactic acid does not comply with IUPAC standard nomenclature, and is potentially ambiguous or confusing, because PLA is not a polyacid  polyelectrolyte , but rather a polyester. 4  Contents 1 Production 2 Materials properties 2.1 Chemical properties 2.2 Physical and mechanical properties 2.3 Solvent welding 2.4 Organic Solvents for PLA 3 Applications 4 Degradation 5 End of life 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Production  edit  Producers have several industrial routes to usable i.e. high molecular weight PLA. Two main monomers are used lactic acid , and the cyclic di-ester, lactide . The most common route to PLA is the ring-opening polymerization of lactide with various metal catalysts typically tin octoate  in solution , in the melt , or as a suspension . The metal-catalyzed reaction tends to cause racemization of the PLA, reducing its stereoregularity compared to the starting material usually corn starch. 5  Another route to PLA is the direct condensation of lactic acid monomers. This process needs to be carried out at less than 200  C above that temperature, the entropically favored lactide monomer is generated. This reaction generates one equivalent of water for every condensation  esterification  step. The condensation reaction is reversible and subject to equilibrium, so removal of water is required to generate high molecular weight species. Water removal by application of a vacuum or by azeotropic distillation is required to drive the reaction toward polycondensation. Molecular weights of 130 kDa can be obtained this way. Even higher molecular weights can be attained by carefully crystallizing the crude polymer from the melt. Carboxylic acid and alcohol end groups are thus concentrated in the amorphous region of the solid polymer, and so they can react. Molecular weights of 128152 kDa are obtainable thus. 5  Polymerization of a racemic mixture of L- and D-lactides usually leads to the synthesis of poly-DL-lactide  PDLLA , which is amorphous. Use of stereospecific catalysts can lead to heterotactic PLA which has been found to show crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity, and hence many important properties, is largely controlled by the ratio of D to L enantiomers used, and to a lesser extent on the type of catalyst used. Apart from lactic acid and lactide, lactic acid O -carboxyanhydride lac-OCA, a five-membered cyclic compound has been used academically as well. This compound is more reactive than lactide, because its polymerization is driven by the loss of one equivalent of carbon dioxide per equivalent of lactic acid. Water is not a co-product. 6  The direct biosynthesis of PLA similar to the polyhydroxyalkanoates has been reported as well. 7  Another method devised is by contacting lactic acid with a zeolite. This condensation reaction is a one-step process, and runs about 100  C lower in temperature. 8  9  Materials properties  edit  Chemical properties  edit  Due to the chiral nature of lactic acid, several distinct forms of polylactide exist poly- L -lactide  PLLA  is the product resulting from polymerization of L , L -lactide also known as L -lactide. PLA is soluble in solvents, hot benzene , tetrahydrofuran , and dioxane . 10  Physical and mechanical properties  edit  PLA polymers range from amorphous glassy polymer to semi-crystalline and highly crystalline polymer with a glass transition of 60   C and melting points of 130-180  C. 11  PLA has a glass transition temperature 6065  C, a melting temperature 173178  C and a tensile modulus 2.716 GPa. 12  13  Heat-resistant PLA can withstand temperatures of 110  C. 14  The basic mechanical properties of PLA are between those of polystyrene and PET. 11  The melting temperature of PLLA can be increased by 4050  C and its heat deflection temperature can be increased from approximately 60  C to up to 190  C by physically blending the polymer with PDLA poly- D -lactide. PDLA and PLLA form a highly regular stereocomplex with increased crystallinity. The temperature stability is maximised when a 11 blend is used, but even at lower concentrations of 310 of PDLA, there is still a substantial improvement. In the later case, PDLA acts as a nucleating agent , thereby increasing the crystallization rate  citation needed  . Biodegradation of PDLA is slower than for PLA due to the higher crystallinity of PDLA  citation needed  . The flexural modulus of PLA is higher than polystyrene and PLA has good heat sealability. Several technologies such as annealing , 15  16  17  adding nucleating agents, forming composites with fibers or nano-particles , 18  19  20  chain extending 21  22  and introducing crosslink structures have been used to enhance the mechanical properties of PLA polymers. Polylactic acid can be processed like most thermoplastics into fiber for example, using conventional melt spinning processes and film. PLA has similar mechanical properties to PETE polymer, but has a significantly lower maximum continuous use temperature. 23  With high surface energy, PLA has easy printability which makes it widely used in 3-D printing. The tensile strength for 3-D printed PLA was previously determined. 24  There is also poly L -lactide- co - D , L -lactide PLDLLA  used as PLDLLATCP scaffolds for bone engineering. 25  26  Solvent welding  edit  PLA can be solvent welded using dichloromethane . 27  Organic Solvents for PLA  edit  PLA has a range of organic solvents 28  that could be used. Ethylacetate, due to its ease of access and low risk of use is of most interest. If the filament is soaked in a small amount it will dissolve and can be used to clean 3D printing extruder heads or remove PLA supports. The boiling point of ethylacetate is low enough to also smoothen PLA in a vapor chamber similar to ABS and acetone. Other safe solvents to use include propylene carbonate which is safer than ethylacetate, however is difficult to purchase commercially. Pyridine can also be used however this is less safer than ethylacetate and propylene carbonate, it also has a distinct bad fish odor. Applications  edit  PLA is used as a feedstock material in desktop fused filament fabrication 3D printers e.g. RepRap . 29  30  PLA printed solids can be encased in plaster-like moulding materials, then burned out in a furnace, so that the resulting void can be filled with molten metal. This is known as lost PLA casting, a type of investment casting. 31  Being able to degrade into innocuous lactic acid, PLA is used as medical implants in the form of anchors, screws, plates, pins, rods, and as a mesh. 32  Depending on the exact type used, it breaks down inside the body within 6 months to 2 years. This gradual degradation is desirable for a support structure, because it gradually transfers the load to the body e.g. the bone as that area heals. The strength characteristics of PLA and PLLA implants are well documented. 33  PLA can also be used as a decomposable packaging material, either cast, injection-molded, or spun. 32  Cups and bags have been made from this material. In the form of a film, it shrinks upon heating, allowing it to be used in shrink tunnels . It is useful for producing loose-fill packaging, compost bags, food packaging, and disposable tableware . In the form of fibers and nonwoven fabrics , PLA also has many potential uses, for example as upholstery , disposable garments, awnings , feminine hygiene products, and diapers . Thanks to its bio-compatibility and biodegradability, PLA has also found ample interest as a polymeric scaffold for drug delivery purposes. Racemic and regular PLLA has a low glass transition temperature, which is undesirable. A stereocomplex of PDLA and PLLA has a higher glass transition temperatures, lending it more mechanical strength. It has a wide range of applications, such as woven shirts ironability, microwavable trays, hot-fill applications and even engineering plastics in this case, the stereocomplex is blended with a rubber-like polymer such as ABS. Such blends also have good form stability and visual transparency, making them useful for low-end packaging applications. Pure poly-L-lactic acid PLLA, on the other hand, is the main ingredient in Sculptra , a long-lasting facial volume enhancer, primarily used for lipoatrophy of cheeks. Progress in biotechnology has resulted in the development of commercial production of the D enantiomer form, something that was not possible until recently. 34  Mulch film made of PLA-blend bio-flex Biodegradable PLA cups in use at a restaurant Tea bags made of PLA.

Transparent PLA. Degradation  edit  Abiotic PLA degradation is due to 3 mechanisms 36  Hydrolysis The ester groups of the main chain are cleaved, dividing the molecule in two parts, thus reducing molecular weight. Thermal degradation A complex phenomenon leading to the appearance of different compounds such as lighter molecules and linear and cyclic oligomers with different Mw , and lactide. Photodegradation Sunlight induces degradation due to low-wavelength and high-energy UV radiation. This is a factor mainly where PLA is exposed to sunlight in its applications in plasticulture , packaging containers and films. The hydrolytic reaction is  COO  H 2 O   COOH   OH  displaystyle ce -COO  H2O -  - COOH  -OH- The degradation rate is very slow in ambient temperatures. A 2017 study found that at 25  C in seawater, PLA showed no degradation over a year. 37  Pure PLA foams undergo selective hydrolysis when placed in an environment of Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum FBS a solution mimicking body fluid. After 30 days of submersion in DMEMFBS, a PLLA scaffold lost about 20 of its weight. 38  PLA samples of varying molecular weight were degraded into methyl lactate a green solvent by using a metal complex catalyst. 39  Some bacteria can also degrade PLA, such as Amycolatopsis and Saccharothrix . A purified protease from Amycolatopsis sp., PLA depolymerase , can also degrade PLA. Enzymes such as pronase and most effectively proteinase K from Tritirachium album degrade PLA. 40  End of life  edit  PLA from different producers  Total Corbion , NatureWorks  has been certified to be compostable in industrial conditions, according to ASTM D6400. The conditions of industrial composting are 58  C in presence of humidity and a processing time of 6 months. 41  42  PLA has SPI resin ID code 7 4 possible end of life scenarios are the most common Recycling which can be either chemical or mechanical. Currently, the SPI resin identification code 7 others is applicable for PLA. In Belgium, Galactic started the first pilot unit to chemically recycle PLA Loopla. Unlike mechanical recycling, waste material can hold various contaminants. Polylactic acid can be recycled to monomer by thermal depolymerization or hydrolysis. When purified, the monomer can be used for the manufacturing of virgin PLA with no loss of original properties  cradle-to-cradle recycling .  dubious  discuss  Composting PLA is biodegradable under industrial composting conditions starting with an hydrolysis process and following with the action of microorganisms to ultimately degrade the PLA. Incineration PLA can be incinerated leaving no residue and producing 19.5MJkg 8,368 btulb of energy. Landfill the less preferable option would be landfilling as PLA degrades very slowly in ambient temperatures.
