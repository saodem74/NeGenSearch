Adele Goldstine From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Adele Katz Born December 21, 1920 New York City , New York, U.S. Died November 1964 Nationality American Alma  mater University of Michigan Known  for First manual on electronic digital computer Scientific career Fields Computer Programming and Mathematics Institutions University of Pennsylvania , Los Alamos National Laboratory Adele Goldstine ne Katz  December 21, 1920  November, 1964 was an American mathematician and computer programmer. She wrote the manual for the first electronic digital computer, ENIAC . Through her work programming the computer, she was also an instrumental player in converting the ENIAC from a computer that needed to be reprogrammed each time it was used to one that was able to perform a set of fifty stored instructions . 1  Contents 1 Early life and education 2 Work on ENIAC 3 Post-war years 4 See also 5 Footnotes 6 References 7 External links Early life and education  edit  Goldstine was born in New York City on December 21, 1920, to Jewish parents. 1  She attended Hunter College High School, then Hunter College . After receiving her B.A, she attended the University of Michigan , where she earned a Masters in mathematics. 2  At Michigan, she met Herman Goldstine , the military liaison and administrator for the construction of the ENIAC, and the two were married in 1941. 2  Work on ENIAC  edit  As an instructor of mathematics for the women  computers  at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering , Goldstine also trained some of the six women who were the original programmers of ENIAC to manually calculate ballistic trajectories complex differential calculations. 3  4  The job of computer was critical to the war effort, and women were regarded as capable of doing the work more rapidly and accurately than men. 5  By 1943, and for the balance of World War II, essentially all computers were women as were many of their direct supervisors. She wrote the Operators Manual for the ENIAC after the six women  Kay McNulty , Betty Jean Jennings , Betty Snyder , Marlyn Wescoff , Fran Bilas and Ruth Lichterman  trained themselves to program the ENIAC using its logical and electrical block diagrams. Reconfiguring the machine to solve a different problem involved physically plugging and unplugging wires on the machine it was called setting-up, as the modern terminology of program had not yet come into use. 6  In 1946 Goldstine sat in on programming sessions with Bartik and Dick Clippinger and was hired to help implement Clippingers stored program modification to the ENIAC. John von Neumann was a consultant on the selection of the instruction set implemented. This solved the problem of the programmers having to unplug and replug patch cables for every program the machine was to run instead the program was entered on the three function tables, which had previously been used only for storage of a trajectorys drag function. ENIAC programmer Jean Bartik called Goldstine one of her three great programming partners along with Betty Holberton and Art Gehring . 7  They worked together to program the Taub program for the ENIAC.  citation needed  Post-war years  edit  After the war, Goldstine continued her programming work with von Neumann at Los Alamos National Laboratory , where she devised problems for ENIAC to process. 1  She had two children, born in 1952 and 1959. 1  She was diagnosed with cancer in 1962 and died two years later at the age of 43 in 1964. 1  See also  edit  Kathleen Antonelli Jean Bartik Betty Holberton Marlyn Meltzer Frances Spence Ruth Teitelbaum Footnotes  edit   a b c d e Jones, J.
