Assigned student editors Rebecca ttt . Well Im still new to this Wikipedia editing experience, I hope suggestion can be given on how improvement should be done to avoid this article to be deleted. Well, since you are brand new, Ive removed the proposed-deletion notice and added an   underconstruction   template to give you a little time to work on this. The main problem is the explanation of just what polymer engineering is. You must remember that you are writing for an audience that likely doesnt understand a polymer, much less polymer engineering. Course syllabuses syllabi dont really give John Q. Public much context. Maybe you could explain some thing that have resu lted from polymer engineering. As for source citations  and since Im guessing youre an educator, I dont have to explain how important sources are  try to find something outside of coursework, such as an article in a general interest magazine or a newspaper. Above all, keep it as simple as you can. Dont worry about getting everything just so right of the bat. And if you ne ed any more help, please leave a message on my talk page . Ive posted some helpful information at the top of your talk page that you might want to read as well. Realkyhick 0513, 13 August 2007 UTC DeviousEgg Dont worry Knight. Ill help you edit this page. Let me finish an assignment I have to do right now and Ill get right to it.
