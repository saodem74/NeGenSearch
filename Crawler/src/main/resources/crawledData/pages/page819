The resulting Museum Project had its first exhibit in 1975, located in a converted coat closet in a DEC lobby. In 1978, the museum, now The Digital Computer Museum TDCM, moved to a larger DEC lobby in Marlborough, Massachusetts . Maurice Wilkes presented the first lecture at TDCM in 1979  the presentation of such lectures has continued to the present time. TDCM incorporated as The Computer Museum TCM in 1982. In 1984, TCM moved to Boston , locating on Museum Wharf . In 19961997, The TCM History Center TCMHC in Silicon Valley was established a site at Moffett Field was provided by NASA an old building that was previously the Naval Base furniture store and a large number of artifacts were shipped there from TCM. In 1999, TCMHC incorporated and TCM ceased operation, shipping its remaining artifacts to TCMHC in 2000. The name TCM had been retained by the Boston Museum of Science so, in 2000, the name TCMHC was changed to Computer History Museum CHM. In 2002, CHM opened its new building previously occupied by Silicon Graphics , at 1401 N. Shoreline Blvd in Mountain View, California , to the public. 1  2  The facility was later heavily renovated and underwent a two-year 19 million makeover before reopening in January 2011. 3  Collections and exhibition space  edit  Steve Russell , creator of Spacewar , operating the PDP-1 at the Computer History Museum Charles Babbages Difference Engine on Display at the Computer History Museum The Computer History Museum claims to house the largest and most significant collection of computing artifacts in the world the Heinz Nixdorf Museum , Paderborn, Germany, has more items on display but a far smaller total collection 1 4  . This includes many rare or one-of-a-kind objects such as a Cray-1 supercomputer as well as a Cray-2 , Cray-3 , the Utah teapot , the 1969 Neiman Marcus Kitchen Computer , an Apple I , and an example of the first generation of Google s racks of custom-designed web servers . 5  The collection comprises nearly 90,000 objects, photographs and films, as well as 4,000 feet 1,200  m of cataloged documentation and several hundred gigabytes of software. The CHM oral history program conducts video interviews around the history of computing and networking, with over 700 as of 2016. The museums 25,000-square-foot 2,300  m 2  exhibit Revolution The First 2000 Years of Computing, opened to the public on January 13, 2011. It covers the history of computing in 20 galleries, from the abacus to the Internet. The entire exhibition is also available online. 6  7  8  The museum features a Liquid Galaxy in the Going Places A History of Silicon Valley exhibit. The exhibit features 20 preselected locations that visitors can fly to on the Liquid Galaxy. 9  The museum has several additional exhibits, including a restoration of an historic PDP-1 minicomputer, two restored IBM 1401 computers, and an exhibit on the history of autonomous vehicles, from torpedoes to self-driving cars. An operating Difference Engine designed by Charles Babbage in the 1840s and constructed by the Science Museum of London was on display until January 31, 2016. It had been on loan since 2008 from its owner, Nathan Myhrvold , a former Microsoft executive. 10  Former media executive John Hollar was appointed CEO of The Computer History Museum in July 2008. In 2010 the museum began with the collection of source code of important software, beginning with Apple s MacPaint 1.3, written in a combination of Assembly and Pascal and available as download for the public. 11  12  In 2012 the APL programming language followed. 13  In February 2013 Adobe Systems, Inc. donated the Photoshop 1.0.1 source code to the collection. 14  15  On March 25, 2014 Microsoft followed with the source code donation of SCP MS-DOS 1.25 and a mixture of Altos MS-DOS 2.11 and TeleVideo PC DOS 2.11 as well as Word for Windows 1.1a under their own license. 16  17  On October 21, 2014, Xerox Alto s source code and other resources followed. 18  Fellows  edit  The CHM Fellows are exceptional men and women whose ideas have changed the world and affected nearly every human alive today.
