It is used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not articles , or it groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This is a hidden category . It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference Show hidden categories is set. This is a tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. Pages are added to tracking categories through templates. This is a category to help keep count of the total number of articles with the   citation needed   template. They should all be in one of the dated categories, which can be found at CategoryArticles with unsourced statements . For the historical size of the backlog, see this offwiki tool .
