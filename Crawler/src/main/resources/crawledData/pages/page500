Template   This template does not require a rating on the projects quality scale .   What qualifies as engineering  edit  I just added Audio engineering and Security engineering to the template. I realize that these could both be considered non-engineering professions, especially audio which requires little formal training. However, they are commonly used job titles, and there are indeed some trained engineers with such titles. For example, an electrical engineer doing extensive sound signal processing is sometimes called an audio engineer. Mamyles  talk  2041, 26 March 2015 UTC Hi Mamyles, I think any field of science which involves technical issues is known as engineering. Thanks for adding those two, we need to add more. I think major fields are just 4 or 5, but we have to add minor fields, we have to add more to have a complete list. Any article in Wiki which is titled Engineering, should be added. If you dont think so, Im curious to listen to your idea. Soroush90gh  talk  2111, 26 March 2015 UTC I think that this template should represent the broad topic of engineering. Due to space it is inevitable that some sub-disciplines will be excluded. For example, there are dozens of engineering articles on List of engineering branches for Biological engineering alone. A Biological engineering fields template would likely be most appropriate to connect these, although Im not opposed to moving it out of Chemical and adding a new Biological line to this template. Note that Ive also just added Fire protection engineering . Ultimately, this template should be improved in conjunction with List of engineering branches and Outline of engineering . New templates for every major discipline should be created to connect sub-disciplines. I unfortunately dont have time to do such extensive work now, but its something to think about, and if anyone does have time please feel free.
