It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. 1  If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop. 2  Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia . 3  4  5  6  7  8  Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor , short-term or working  memory, and long-term memory . 9  This can be related to the neuron . The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor. The working m emory also retrieves information from previously stored material. Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems. 9  Declarative, or explicit, memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data. 10  Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory . Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning, 2  while episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane. 11  12  13  Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory. 2  Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information. 14  An example of a non-declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory , or a priming phenomenon. 2  14  15  Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that not all memory is consciously activated, 15  whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills that often occurs without conscious attention to learning. 2  14  Memory is not a perfect processor, and is affected by many factors. The ways by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved can all be corrupted. The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage. 2  Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus. 16  17  Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory. 2  Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory. 18  19  Contents 1 Sensory memory 2 Short-term memory 3 Long-term memory 3.1 Multi-store model 3.2 Working memory 4 Types 4.1 By information type 4.1.1 Declarative 4.1.2 Procedural 4.2 By temporal direction 5 Study techniques 5.1 To assess infants 5.2 To assess older children and adults 6 Failures 7 Physiology 8 Cognitive neuroscience 9 Genetics 10 In infancy 11 Aging 12 Disorders 13 Influencing factors 14 Stress 15 Sleep 16 Construction for general manipulation 17 Improving 18 In plants 19 See also 20 Notes 21 References 22 Further reading 23 External links Sensory memory  edit  Main article Sensory memory Sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived. The ability to look at an item and remember what it looked like with just a split second of observation, or memorization, is the example of sensory memory. It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response. With very short presentations, participants often report that they seem t o see more than they can actually report. The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were precisely conducted by George Sperling 1963 20  using the partial report paradigm. Subjects were presented with a grid of 12 letters, arranged into three rows of four. After a brief presentation, subjects were then played either a high, medium or low tone, cuing them which of the rows to report. Based on these partial report experiments, Sperling was able to show that the capacity of sensory memory was approximately 12 items, but that it degraded very quickly within a few hundred milliseconds. Because this form of memory degrades so quickly, participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items 12 in the whole report procedure before they decayed. This type of memory cannot be prolonged via rehearsal. Three types of sensory memories exist. Iconic memory is a fast decaying store of visual information a type of sensory memory that briefly stores an image which has been perceived for a small duration. Echoic memory is a fast decaying store of auditory information, another type of sensory memory that briefly stores sounds that have been perceived for short durations. 21  Haptic memory is a type of sensory memory that represents a database for touch stimuli. Short-term memory  edit  Main article Short-term memory Short-term memory is also known as working memory . Short-term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal. Its capacity is also very limited George A. Miller 1956, when working at Bell Laboratories , conducted experiments showing that the store of short-term memory was 72 items the title of his famous paper,  The magical number 72 . Modern estimates of the capacity of short-term memory are lower, typically of the order of 45 items 22  however, memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking . 23  For example, in recalling a ten-digit telephone number , a person could chunk the digits into three groups first, the area code such as 123, then a three-digit chunk 456 and lastly a four-digit chunk 7890. This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers. This may be ref lected in some countries in the tendency to display telephone numbers as several chunks of two to four numbers. Short-term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information, and to a lesser extent a visual code. Conrad 1964 24  found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar e.g. E, P, D. Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically. Conrads 1964 study, however, deals with the encoding of written text thus, while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components, generalisations to all forms of memory cannot be made. Long-term memory  edit  Main article Long-term memory Olin Levi Warner , Memory 1896. Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building , Washington, D.C. The storage in sensory memory and short-term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration, which means that information is not retained indefinitely. By contrast, long-term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration sometimes a whole life span. Its capacity is immeasurable. For example, given a random seven-digit number, one may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting, suggesting it was stored in short-term memory. On the other hand, one can remember telephone numbers for many years through repetition this information is said to be stored in long-term memory. While short-term memory encodes information acoustically, long-term memory encodes it semantically Baddeley 1966 25  discovered that, after 20 minutes, test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings e.g. big, large, great, huge long-term. Another part of long-term memory is episodic memory, which attempts to capture information such as what, when and where  . 26  With episodic memory, individuals are able to recall specific events such as birthday parties and weddings. Short-term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the frontal lobe especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  and the parietal lobe . Long-term memory, on the other hand, is maintained by more stable and permanent changes in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain. The hippocampus is essential for learning new information to the consolidation of information from short-term to long-term memory, although it does not seem to store information itself. It was thought that without the hippocampus new memories were unable to be stored into long-term memory and that there would be a very short attention span , as first gleaned from patient Henry Molaison 27  after what was thought to be the full removal of both his hippocampi. More recent examination of his brain, post-mortem, shows that the hippocampus was more intact than first thought, throwing theories drawn from the initial data into question. The hippocampus may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning. Research has suggested that long-term memory storage in humans may be maintained by DNA methylation , 28  and the prion gene . 29  30  Multi-store model  edit  See also Memory consolidation The multi-store model also known as AtkinsonShiffrin memory model  was first described in 1968 by Atkinson and Shiffrin . The multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and procedural memory . It also proposes that rehearsal is the only mechanism by which information eventually reaches long-term storage, but evidence shows us capable of remembering things without rehearsal. The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information. In a study by Zlonoga and Gerber 1986, patient KF demonstrated certain deviations from the AtkinsonShiffrin model. Patient KF was brain damaged , displaying difficulties regarding short-term memory. Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers, letters, words and easily identifiable noises such as doorbells and cats meowing were all impacted. Visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory. 31  Working memory  edit  Main article Working memory The working memory model In 1974 Baddeley and Hitch proposed a working memory model that replaced the general concept of short-term memory with an active maintenance of information in the short-term storage. In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores the central executive, the phonological loop and the visuo-spatial sketchpad. In 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal epi sodic buffer  Baddeleys model of working memory . 32  The central executive essentially acts as an attention sensory store. It channels information to the three component processes the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer. The phonological loop stores auditory information by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a continuous loop the articulatory process for example the repetition of a telephone number over and over again. A short list of data is easier to remember. The visuospatial sketchpad stores visual and spatial information. It is engaged when performing spatial tasks such as judging distances or visual ones such as counting the windows on a house or imagining images. The episodic buffer is dedicated to linking information across domains to form integrated units of visual, spatial, and verbal information and chronological ordering e.g., the memory of a story or a movie scene. The episodic buffer is also assumed to have links to long-term memory and semantical meaning. The working memory model explains many practical observations, such as why it is easier to do two different tasks one verbal and one visual than two similar tasks e.g., two visual, and the aforementioned word-length effect. Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thoug ht processes and use them to learn and reason about topics. 32  Types  edit  Researchers distinguish between recognition and recall memory. Recognition memory tasks require individuals to indicate whether they have encountered a stimulus such as a picture or a word before. Recall memory tasks require participants to retrieve previously learned information. For example, individuals might be asked to produce a series of actions they have seen before or to say a list of words they have heard before. By information type  edit  Topographic memory involves the ability to orient oneself in space, to recognize and follow an itinerary, or to recognize familiar places. 33  Getting lost when traveling alone is an example of the failure of topographic memory. 34  Flashbulb memories are clear episodic memories of unique and highly emotional events. 35  People remembering where they were or what they were doing when they first heard the news of President Kennedy s assassination , 36  the Sydney Siege or of 911 are examples of flashbulb memories. Anderson 1976 37  divides long-term memory into declarative explicit and procedural implicit memories. Declarative  edit  Main article Declarative memory Declarative memory requires conscious recall , in that some conscious process must call back the information. It is sometimes called explicit memory , since it consists of information that is explicitly stored and retrieved. Declarative memory can be further sub-divided into semantic memory , concerning principles and facts taken independent of context and episodic memory , concerning information specific to a particular context, such as a time and place. Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world, such as Paris is the capital of France. Episodic memory, on the other hand, is used for more personal memories, such as the sensations, emotions, and personal associations of a particular place or time. Episodic memories often reflect the firsts in life such as a first kiss, first day of school or first time winning a championship. These are key events in ones life that can be remembered clearly. Autobiographical memory  memory for particular events within ones own life  is generally viewed as either equivalent to, or a subset of, episodic memory. Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. One is able to place in memory information that resembles objects, places, animals or people in sort of a mental image . Visual memory can result in priming and it is assumed some kind of perceptual representational system underlies this phenomenon.  citation needed  Procedural  edit  In contrast, procedural memory or implicit memory  is not based on the conscious recall of information, but on implicit learning . It can best be summarized as remembering how to do something. Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory. It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition  no new explicit memories have been formed, but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences. Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the cerebellum and basal ganglia . A characteristic of procedural memory is that the things remembered are automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include the ability to ride a bike or tie shoelaces. 38  By temporal direction  edit  Another major way to distinguish different memory functions is whether the content to be remembered is in the past, retrospective memory , or in the future, prospective memory . Thus, retrospective memory as a category includes semantic, episodic and autobiographical memory. In contrast, prospective memory is memory for future intentions, or remembering to remember Winograd, 1988. Prospective memory can be further broken down into event- and time-based prospective remembering. Time-based prospective memories are triggered by a time-cue, such as going to the doctor action at 4pm cue. Event-based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues, such as remembering to post a letter action after seeing a mailbox cue. Cues do not need to be related to the action as the mailboxletter example, and lists, sticky-notes, knotted handkerchiefs, or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory. Study techniques  edit  To assess infants  edit  Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports cannot be used to assess very young childrens memory. Throughout the years, however, researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both infants recognition memory and their recall memory. Habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess infants recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess infants recall memory. Techniques used to assess infants recognition memory include the following Visual paired comparison procedure relies on habituation  infants are first presented with pairs of visual stimuli, such as two black-and-white photos of human faces, for a fixed amount of time then, after being familiarized with the two photos, they are presented with the familiar photo and a new photo. The time spent looking at each photo is recorded. Looking longer at the new photo indicates that they remember the familiar one. Studies using this procedure have found that 5- to 6-month-olds can retain information for as long as fourteen days. 39  Operant conditioning technique  infants are placed in a crib and a ribbon that is connected to a mobile overhead is tied to one of their feet. Infants notice that when they kick their foot the mobile moves  the rate of kicking increases dramatically within minutes. Studies using this technique have revealed that infants memory substantially improves over the first 18-months. Whereas 2- to 3-month-olds can retain an operant response such as activating the mobile by kicking their foot for a week, 6-month-olds can retain it for two weeks, and 18-month-olds can retain a similar operant response for as long as 13 weeks. 40  41  42  Techniques used to assess infants recall memory include the following Deferred imitation technique  an experimenter shows infants a unique sequence of actions such as using a stick to push a button on a box and then, after a delay, asks the infants to imitate the actions. Studies using deferred imitation have shown that 14-month-olds memories for the sequence of actions can last for as long as four months. 43  Elicited imitation technique  is very similar to the deferred imitation technique the difference is that infants are allowed to imitate the actions before the delay. Studies using the elicited imitation technique have shown that 20-month-olds can recall the action sequences twelve months later. 44  45  To assess older children and adults  edit  Researchers use a variety of tasks to assess older children and adults memory. Some examples are Paired associate learning  when one learns to associate one specific word with another. For example, when given a word such as safe one must learn to say another specific word, such as green. This is stimulus and response. 46  47  Free recall  during this task a subject would be asked to study a list of words and then later they will be asked to recall or write down as many words that they can remember, similar to free response questions. 48  Earlier items are affected by retroactive interference RI, which means the longer the list, the greater the interference, and the less likelihood that they are recalled. On the other hand, items that have been presented lastly suffer little RI, but suffer a great deal from proactive interference PI, which means the longer the delay in recall, the more likely that the items will be lost. 49  Cued recall  one is given significant hints about the information. This is similar to fill in the blank assessments used in classrooms. Recognition  subjects are asked to remember a list of words or pictures, after which point they are asked to identify the previously presented words or pictures from among a list of alternatives that were not presented in the original list. 50  This is similar to multiple choice assessments. Detection paradigm  individuals are shown a number of objects and color samples during a certain period of time. They are then tested on their visual ability to remember as much as they can by looking at testers and pointing out whether the testers are similar to the sample, or if any change is present. Savings method  compares the speed of originally learning to the speed of relearning it. The amount of time saved measures memory. 51  Implicit-memory tasks  information is drawn from memory without conscious realization. Failures  edit  The garden of oblivion, illustration by Ephraim Moses Lilien . Transience  memories degrade with the passing of time. This occurs in the storage stage of memory, after the information has been stored and before it is retrieved. This can happen in sensory, short-term, and long-term storage. It follows a general pattern where the information is rapidly forgotten during the first couple of days or years, followed by small losses in later days or years . Absent-mindedness  Memory failure due to the lack of attention . Attention plays a key role in storing information into long-term memory without proper attention, the information might not be stored, making it impossible to be retrieved later. Physiology  edit  Brain areas involved in the neuroanatomy of memory such as the hippocampus , the amygdala , the striatum , or the mammillary bodies are thought to be involved in specific types of memory. For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning , while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory . 52  Damage to certain areas in patients and animal models and subsequent memory deficits is a primary source of information. However, rather than implicating a specific area, it could be that damage to adjacent areas, or to a pathway traveling through the area is actually responsible for the observed deficit. Further, it is not sufficient to describe memory, and its counterpart, learning , as solely dependent on specific brain regions. Learning and memory are usually attributed to changes in neuronal synapses , thought to be mediated by long-term potentiation and long-term depression . However, this has been questioned on computational as well as neurophysiological grounds by the cognitive scientist Charles R. Gallistel and others. 53  54  55  In general, the more emotionally charged an event or experience is, the better it is remembered this phenomenon is known as the memory enhancement effect . Patients with amygdala damage, however, do not show a memory enhancement effect. 56  57  Hebb distinguished between short-term and long-term memory. He postulated that any memory that stayed in short-term storage for a long enough time would be consolidated into a long-term memory. Later research showed this to be false. Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences. This is also true for stimulation of the amygdala. This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala. Excessive or prolonged stress with prolonged cortisol may hurt memory storage. Patients with amygdalar damage are no more likely to remember emotionally charged words than nonemotionall y charged ones. The hippocampus is important for explicit memory. The hippocampus is also important for memory consolidation. The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also. The input comes from secondary and tertiary sensory areas that have processed the information a lot already. Hippocampal dama ge may also cause memory loss and problems with memory storage. 58  This memory loss includes retrograde amnesia which is the loss of memory for events that occurred shortly before the time of brain damage. 51  Cognitive neuroscience  edit  Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention, reactivation, and reconstruction of the experience-independent internal representation. The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level, and the underpinning physical neural changes Dudai 2007. The latter component is also called engram or memory traces Semon 1904. Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory, broadly conceiving all persisting after-effects of experiences as memory others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought Moscovitch 2007. One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain. Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity, but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory, particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events Byrne 2007. Convergence-divergence zones might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved. Considering that there are several kinds of memory, depending on types of represented knowledge, underlying mechanisms, processes functions and modes of acquisition, it is likely that different brain areas support different memory systems and that they are in mutual relationships in neuronal networks compo nents of memory representation are distributed widely across different parts of the brain as mediated by multiple neocortical circuits. 59  Encoding . Encoding of working memory involves the spiking of individual neurons induced by sensory input, which persists even after the sensory input disappears Jensen and Lisman 2005 Fransen et al. 2002. Encoding of episodic memory involves persistent changes in molecular structures that alter synaptic transmission between neurons. Examples of such structural changes include long-term potentiation LTP or spike-timing-dependent plasticity STDP. The persistent spiking in working memory can enhance the synaptic and cellular changes in the encoding of episodic memory Jensen and Lisman 2005. Working memory. Recent functional imaging studies detected working memory signals in both medial temporal lobe MTL, a brain area strongly associated with long-term memory , and prefrontal cortex Ranganath et al. 2005, suggesting a strong relationship between working memory and long-term memory. However, the substantially more working memory signals seen in the prefrontal lobe suggest that this area play a more important role in working memory than MTL Suzuki 2007. Consolidation and reconsolidation . Short-term memory STM is temporary and subject to disruption, while long-term memory LTM, once consolidated, is persistent and stable. Consolidation of STM into LTM at the molecular level presumably involves two processes synaptic consolidation and system consolidation. The former involves a protein synthesis process in the medial temporal lobe MTL, whereas the latter transforms the MTL- dependent memory into an MTL-independent memory over months to years Ledoux 2007. In recent years, such traditional consolidation dogma has been re-evaluated as a result of the studies on reconsolidation. These studies showed that prevention after retrieval affects subsequent retrieval of the memory Sara 2000. New studies have shown that post-retrieval treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors and many other compounds can lead to an amnestic state Nadel et al. 2000b Alberini 2005 Dudai 2006. These findings on reconsolidation fit with the behavioral evidence that retrieved memory is not a carbon copy of the initial experi ences, and memories are updated during retrieval. Genetics  edit  Study of the genetics of human memory is in its infancy. A notable initial success was the association of APOE with memory dysfunction in Alzheimers Disease . The search for genes associated with normally varying memory continues. One of the first candidates for normal variation in memory is the protein KIBRA , 60  which appears to be associated with the rate at which material is forgotten over a delay period. There has been some evidence that memories are stored in the nucleus of neurons. 61   non-primary source needed  In infancy  edit  For the inability of adults to retrieve early memories, see Childhood amnesia . Up until the mid-1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode, retain, and retrieve information. 62  A growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as 6-months can recall information after a 24-hour delay. 63  Furthermore, research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time 6-month-olds can recall information after a 24-hour period, 9-month-olds after up to five weeks, and 20-month-olds after as long as twelve months. 64  In addition, studies have shown that with age, infants can store information faster. Whereas 14-month-olds can recall a three-step sequence after being exposed to it once, 6-month-olds need approximately six exposures in order to be able to remember it. 43  63  Although 6-month-olds can recall information over the short-term, they have difficulty recalling the temporal order of information. It is only by 9 months of age that infants can recall the actions of a two-step sequence in the correct temporal order  that is, recalling step 1 and then step 2. 65  66  In other words, when asked to imitate a two-step action sequence such as putting a toy car in the base and pushing in the plunger to make the toy roll to the other end, 9-month-olds tend to imitate the actions of the sequence in the correct order step 1 and then step 2. Younger infants 6-month-olds can only recall one step of a two-step sequence. 63  Researchers have suggested that these age differences are probably due to the fact that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontal components of the neural network are not fully developed at the age of 6-months. 44  67  68  In fact, the term infantile amnesia refers to the phenomenon of accelerated forgetting during infancy. Importantly, infantile amnesia is not unique to humans, and preclinical research using rodent models provides insight into the precise neurobiology of this phenomenon. A review of the literature from behavioral neuroscientist Dr Jee Hyun Kim suggests that accelerated forgetting during early life is at least partly due to rapid growth of the brain during this period. 69  Aging  edit  Main article Memory and aging One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss , especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimers disease . However, memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimers Budson  Price, 2005. Research has revealed that individuals performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on tasks that involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information 70  source memory tasks that require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information 71  and prospective memory tasks that involve remembering to perform an act at a future time. Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books, for example. Gene transcription profiles were determined for the human frontal cortex of individuals from age 26 to 106 years. Numerous genes were identified with reduced expression after age 40, and especially after age 70. 72  Genes that play central roles in memory and learning were among those showing the most significant reduction with age. There was also a marked increase in DNA damage , likely oxidative damage , in the promoters of those genes with reduced expression. It was suggested that DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable genes involved in memory and learning. 72  Disorders  edit  Main article Memory disorder Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders , particularly amnesia. Loss of memory is known as amnesia . Amnesia can result from extensive damage to a the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices 73  or the b midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. 74  There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brains memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease 75  can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia , or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individuals autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored. 76  Korsakoffs syndrome , also known as Korsakoffs psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex. 51  While not a disorder, a common temporary failure of word retrieval from memory is the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon . Sufferers of Anomic aphasia also called Nominal aphasia or Anomia, however, do experience the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon on an ongoing basis due to damage to the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain . Influencing factors  edit  Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval. There is retroactive interference , when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information 77  and proactive interference , where prior learning disrupts recall of new information. Although interference can lead to forgetting, it is important to keep in mind that there are situations when old information can facilitate learning of new information. Knowing Latin, for instance, can help an individual learn a related language such as French  this phenomenon is known as positive transfer. 78  Stress  edit  Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning. In response to stressful situations, the brain releases hormones and neurotransmitters ex. glucocorticoids and catecholamines which affect memory encoding processes in the hippocampus. Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats. 79  An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans. 80  In this study, 48 healthy female and male university students participated in either a stress test or a control group. Those randomly assigned to the stress test group had a hand immersed in ice cold water the reputable SECPT or Socially Evaluated Cold Pressor Test for up to three minutes, while being monitored and videotaped. Both the stress and control groups were th en presented with 32 words to memorize. Twenty-four hours later, both groups were tested to see how many words they could remember free recall as well as how many they could recognize from a larger list of words recognition performance. The results showed a clear impairment of memory performance in the stress test group, who recalled 30 fewer words than the control group. The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process. However, memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context, even when learning occurs under stress. A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task i.e., in the same room, memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated. 81  Seventy-two healthy female and male university students, randomly assigned to the SECPT stress test or to a control group, were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards  a computerized version of the card game Concentration or Memory. The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla, as odour is a strong cue for memory. Retention testing took place the following day, either in the same room with the vanilla scent ag ain present, or in a different room without the fragrance. The memory performance of subjects who experienced stress during the object-location task decreased significantly when they were tested in an unfamiliar room without the vanilla scent an incongruent context however, the memory performance of stressed subjects showed no impairment when they were tested in the orig inal room with the vanilla scent a congruent context. All participants in the experiment, both stressed and unstressed, performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar. 82  This research on the effects of stress on memory may have practical implications for education, for eyewitness testimony and for psychotherapy students may perform better when tested in their regular classroom rather than an exam room, eyewitnesses may recall details better at the scene of an event than in a courtroom, and persons suffering from post-traumatic stress may improve when helped to situate their memories of a traumatic event in an appropriate context. Stressful life experiences may be a cause of memory loss as a person ages. Glucocorticoids that are released during stress, damage neurons that are located in the hippocampal region of the brain. Therefore, the more stressful situations that someone encounters, the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on. The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate . This high level of extracellular glutamate allows calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons. Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind. 51  This directly relates to traumatic events in ones past such as kidnappings, being prisoners of war or sexual abuse as a child. The more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after t he exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they often have difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied pre natally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life. 83  Sleep  edit  Making memories occurs through a three-step process, which can be enhanced by sleep . The three steps are as follows Acquisition which is the process of storage and retrieval of new information in memory Consolidation Recall Sleep affects memory consolidation. During sleep, the neural connections in the brain are strengthened. This enhances the brains abilities to stabilize and retain memories. There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory, as memories are enhanced through active consolidation. System consolidation takes place during slow-wave sleep SWS. 84  This process implicates that memories are reactivated during sleep, but that the process doesnt enhance every memory. It also implicates that qualitative changes are made to the memories when they are transferred to long-term store during sleep. During sleep, the hippocampus replays the events of the day for the neocortex. The neocortex then reviews and processes memories, w hich moves them into long-term memory. When one does not get enough sleep it makes it more difficult to learn as these neural connections are not as strong, resulting in a lower retention rate of memories. Sleep deprivation makes it harder to focus, resulting in inefficient learning. 84  Furthermore, some studies have shown that sleep deprivation can lead to false memories as the memories are not properly transferred to long-term memory. One of the primary functions of sleep is thought to be the improvement of the consolidation of information, as several studies have demonstrated that memory depends on getting sufficient sleep between training and test. 85  Additionally, data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day, 85  suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal. 86  Construction for general manipulation  edit  Although people often think that memory operates like recording equipment, it is not the case. The molecular mechanisms underlying the induction and maintenance of memory are very dynamic and comprise distinct phases covering a time window from seconds to even a lifetime. 87  In fact, research has revealed that our memories are constructed current hypotheses suggest that constructive processes allow individuals to simulate and imagine future episodes, happenings, and scenarios. Since the future is not an exact repetition of the past, simulation of future episodes requires a complex system that can draw on the past in a manner that flexibly extrac ts and recombines elements of previous experiences  a constructive rather than a reproductive system. 59  People can construct their memories when they encode them andor when they recall them. To illustrate, consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer 1974 88  in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw. The researchers found that the people who were asked, How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other gave higher estimates than those who were asked, How fast were the cars going when they hit each other Furthermore, when asked a week later whether they had seen broken glass in the film, those who had been asked the question with smashed were twice more likely to report that they had seen broken glass than those who had been asked the question with hit . There was no broken glass depicted in the film. Thus, the wording of the questions distorted viewers memories of the event. Importantly, the wording of the question led people to construct different memories of the event  those who were asked the question with smashed recalled a more serious car accident than they had actually seen. The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world, and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect . 89  Research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories. For instance, Goff and Roediger 90  1998 asked participants to imagine that they performed an act e.g., break a toothpick and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing. Findings revealed that those participants who repeatedly imagined performing such an act were more likely to think that they had actually performed that act during the first session of the experiment. Similarly, Garry and her colleagues 1996 91  asked college students to report how certain they were that they experienced a number of events as children e.g., broke a window with their hand and then two weeks later asked them to imagine four of those events. The researchers found that one-fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children. That is, when asked to imagine the events they were more confident that they experienced the events. Research reported in 2013 revealed that it is possible to artificially stimulate prior memories and artificially implant false memories in mice. Using optogenetics , a team of RIKEN-MIT scientists caused the mice to incorrectly associate a benign environment with a prior unpleasant experience from different surroundings. Some scientists believe that the study may have implications in studying false memory formation in humans, and in treating PTSD and schizophrenia . 92  93  Improving  edit  Main article Improving memory A UCLA research study published in the June 2008 issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises, healthy eating , physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives. This study examined 17 subjects, average age 53 with normal memory performance. Eight subjects were asked to follow a brain healthy diet, relaxation, physical, and mental exercise brain teasers and verbal memory training techniques. After 14 days, they showed greater word fluency not memory compared to their baseline performance. No long-term fo llow-up was conducted it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory. 94  There are a loosely associated group of mnemonic principles and techniques that can be used to vastly improve memory known as the art of memory . The International Longevity Center released in 2001 a report 95  which includes in pages 1416 recommendations for keeping the mind in good functionality until advanced age. Some of the recommendations are to stay intellectually active through learning, training or reading, to keep physically active so to promote blood circulation to the brain, to socialize, to reduce stress, to keep sleep time regular, to avoid depression or emotional inst ability and to observe good nutrition. Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim. Rote learning is the method most often used. Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers, such as Cosmos Rossellius using visual alphabets . The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time. In contrast to this is cramming  an intensive memorization in a short period of time. the spacing effect is exploited to improve memory in spaced repetition flashcard training. Also relevant is the Zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. The so-called Method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non-spatial information. 96  In plants  edit  Plants lack a specialized organ devoted to memory retention, and so plant memory has been a controversial topic in recent years. New advances in the field have identified the presence of neurotransmitters in plants, adding to the hypothesis that plants are capable of remembering. 97  Action potentials , a physiological response characteristic of neurons , have been shown to have an influence on plants as well, including in wound responses and photosynthesis . 97  In addition to these homologous features of memory systems in both plants and animals, plants have also been observed to encode, store and retrieve basic short-term memories. One of the most well-studied plants to show rudimentary memory is the Venus flytrap . Native to the subtropical wetlands of the eastern United States, Venus Fly Traps have evolved the ability to obtain meat for sustenance, likely due to the lack of nitrogen in the soil. 98  This is done by two trap-forming leaf tips that snap shut once triggered by a potential prey. On each lobe, three triggers hairs await stimulation. In order to maximize the benefit to cost ratio, the plant enables a rudimentary form of memory in which two trigger hairs must be stimulated within 30 seconds in order to result in trap closure. 98  This system ensures that the trap only closes when potential prey is within grasp. The time lapse between trigger hair stimulations suggests that the plant can remember an initial stimulus long enough for a second stimulus to initiate trap closure. This memory isnt encoded in a brain, as plants lack this specialized organ. Rather, information is stored in the form of cytoplasmic calcium levels. The first trigger causes a subthreshold cytoplasmic calcium infl ux. 98  This initial trigger isnt enough to activate trap closure, and so a subsequent stimulus allows for a secondary influx of calcium. The latter calcium rise superimposes on the initial one, creating an action potential that passes threshold, resulting in trap closure. 98  Researchers, to prove that an electrical threshold must be met to stimulate trap closure, excited a single trigger hair with a constant mechanical stimulus using AgAgCl electrodes. 99  The trap closed after only a few seconds. This experiment gave evidence to demonstrate that the electrical threshold, not necessarily the number of trigger hair stimulations, was the contributing factor in Venus Fly Trap memory. It has been shown that trap closure can be blocked using uncouplers and inhibitors of voltage-gated channels . 99  After trap closure, these electrical signals stimulate glandular production of jasmonic acid and hydrolases , allowing for digestion of the prey. 100  The field of plant neurobiology has gained a large amount of interest over the past decade, leading to an influx of research regarding plant memory. Although the Venus flytrap is one of the more highly studied, many other plants exhibit the capacity to remember, including the Mimosa pudica through an experiment conducted by Monica Gagliano and colleagues in 2013. 101  As the field expands, it is likely that we will learn more about the capacity of a plant to remember.
