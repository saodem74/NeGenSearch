It is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers  1  in order to represent a number N , an arbitrarily chosen symbol representing 1 is repeated N times. 2  For example, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... would be represented in this system as 3  1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111... These numbers should be distinguished from repunits , which are also written as sequences of ones but have their usual decimal numerical interpretation. This system is used in tallying . For example, using the tally mark  , the number 3 is represented as    . In East Asian cultures, the number three is represented as    1 and 2 are represented similarly, a character that is drawn with three strokes. 4  In China and Japan, the character  is used to represent five in some situations because it is drawn with 5 strokes. 5  6  Contents 1 Operations 2 Complexity 3 Applications 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Operations  edit  Addition and subtraction are particularly simple in the unary system, as they involve little more than string concatenation . 7  The Hamming weight or population count operation that counts the number of nonzero bits in a sequence of binary values may also be interpreted as a conversion from unary to binary numbers . 8  However, multiplication is more cumbersome and has often been used as a test case for the design of Turing machines . 9  10  11  Complexity  edit  Compared to standard positional numeral systems , the unary system is inconvenient and hence is not used in practice for large calculations. It occurs in some decision problem descriptions in theoretical computer science e.g. some P-complete problems, where it is used to artificially decrease the run-time or space requirements of a problem. For instance, the problem of integer factorization is suspected to require more than a polynomial function of the length of the input as run-time if the input is given in binary , but it only needs linear runtime if the input is presented in unary. 12  13   permanent dead link  However, this is potentially misleading. Using a unary input is slower for any given number, not faster the distinction is that a binary or larger base input is proportional to the base 2 or larger base logarithm of the number while unary input is proportional to the number itself. Therefore, while the run-time and space requirement in unary looks better as function of th e input size, it does not represent a more efficient solution. 14  In computational complexity theory , unary numbering is used to distinguish strongly NP-complete problems from problems that are NP-complete but not strongly NP-complete. A problem in which the input includes some numerical parameters is strongly NP-complete if it remains NP-complete even when the size of the input is made artificially larger by representing the parameters in unary. For such a problem, there exist hard instances for which all parameter values are at most polynomially large. 15  Applications  edit  Unary numbering is used as part of some data compression algorithms such as Golomb coding . 16  It also forms the basis for the Peano axioms for formalizing arithmetic within mathematical logic . 17  A form of unary notation called Church encoding is used to represent numbers within lambda calculus . 18  See also  edit  Unary coding One-hot encoding References  edit   Hodges, Andrew 2009, One to Nine The Inner Life of Numbers , Anchor Canada, p.  14, ISBN   9780385672665 , The simplest way to write the natural numbers is by the unary notation .mw-parser-output cite.citationfont-styleinherit.mw-parser-output .citation qquotes.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lock-green.svg9px-Lock-green.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-registration abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lock-gray-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLock-red-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em ce nter.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registrationcolor555.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration spanborder-bottom1px dottedcursorhelp.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisource-logo.svg12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output code.cs1-codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginherit.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-errordisplaynonefont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-errorfont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33margin-left0.3em.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-outpu t .cs1-formatfont-size95.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-leftpadding-left0.2em.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-rightpadding-right0.2em .
