Mathematical analysis From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Branch of mathematics A strange attractor arising from a differential equation . Differential equations are an important area of mathematical analysis with many applications to science and engineering . Mathematical analysis is the branch of mathematics dealing with limits and related theories, such as differentiation , integration , measure , infinite series , and analytic functions . 1  2  These theories are usually studied in the context of real and complex numbers and functions . Analysis evolved from calculus , which involves the elementary concepts and techniques of analysis. Analysis may be distinguished from geometry  however, it can be applied to any space of mathematical objects that has a definition of nearness a topological space  or specific distances between objects a metric space .

This was an early but informal example of a limit , one of the most basic concepts in mathematical analysis. Mathematical analysis formally developed in the 17th century during the Scientific Revolution , 3  but many of its ideas can be traced back to earlier mathematicians. Early results in analysis were implicitly present in the early days of ancient Greek mathematics. For instance, an infinite geometric sum is implicit in Zenos paradox of the dichotomy . 4  Later, Greek mathematicians such as Eudoxus and Archimedes made more explicit, but informal, use of the concepts of limits and convergence when they used the method of exhaustion to compute the area and volume of regions and solids. 5  The explicit use of infinitesimals appears in Archimedes The Method of Mechanical Theorems , a work rediscovered in the 20th century. 6  In Asia, the Chinese mathematician Liu Hui used the method of exhaustion in the 3rd century AD to find the area of a circle. 7  Zu Chongzhi established a method that would later be called Cavalieris principle to find the volume of a sphere in the 5th century. 8  The Indian mathematician Bhskara II gave examples of the derivative and used what is now known as Rolles theorem in the 12th century. 9  In the 14th century, Madhava of Sangamagrama developed infinite series expansions, like the power series and the Taylor series , of functions such as sine , cosine , tangent and arctangent . 10  Alongside his development of the Taylor series of the trigonometric functions , he also estimated the magnitude of the error terms created by truncating these series and gave a rational approximation of an infinite series. His followers at the Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics further expanded his works, up to the 16th century. The modern foundations of mathematical analysis were established in 17th century Europe. 3  Descartes and Fermat independently developed analytic geometry , and a few decades later Newton and Leibniz independently developed infinitesimal calculus , which grew, with the stimulus of applied work that continued through the 18th  century, into analysis topics such as the calculus of variations , ordinary and partial differential equations , Fourier analysis , and generating functions . During this period, calculus techniques were applied to approximate discrete problems by continuous ones. In the 18th century, Euler introduced the notion of mathematical function . 11  Real analysis began to emerge as an independent subject when Bernard Bolzano introduced the modern definition of continuity in 1816, 12  but Bolzanos work did not become widely known until the 1870s. In 1821, Cauchy began to put calculus on a firm logical foundation by rejecting the principle of the generality of algebra widely used in earlier work, particularly by Euler. Instead, Cauchy formulated calculus in terms of geometric ideas and infinitesimals . Thus, his definition of continuity required an infinitesimal change in x to correspond to an infinitesimal change in y . He also introduced the concept of the Cauchy sequence , and started the formal theory of complex analysis . Poisson , Liouville , Fourier and others studied partial differential equations and harmonic analysis . The contributions of these mathematicians and others, such as Weierstrass , developed the , -definition of limit approach, thus founding the modern field of mathematical analysis. In the middle of the 19th century Riemann introduced his theory of integration . The last third of the century saw the arithmetization of analysis by Weierstrass , who thought that geometric reasoning was inherently misleading, and introduced the epsilon-delta definition of limit . Then, mathematicians started worrying that they were assuming the existence of a continuum of real numbers without proof. Dedekind then constructed the real numbers by Dedekind cuts , in which irrational numbers are formally defined, which serve to fill the gaps between rational numbers, thereby creating a complete set the continuum of real numbers, which had already been developed by Simon Stevin in terms of decimal expansions . Around that time, the attempts to refine the theorems of Riemann integration led to the study of the size of the set of discontinuities of real functions. Also,  monsters   nowhere continuous functions , continuous but nowhere differentiable functions , space-filling curves  began to be investigated. In this context, Jordan developed his theory of measure , Cantor developed what is now called naive set theory , and Baire proved the Baire category theorem . In the early 20th century, calculus was formalized using an axiomatic set theory . Lebesgue solved the problem of measure, and Hilbert introduced Hilbert spaces to solve integral equations . The idea of normed vector space was in the air, and in the 1920s Banach created functional analysis . Important concepts  edit  Metric spaces  edit  Main article Metric space In mathematics , a metric space is a set where a notion of distance called a metric  between elements of the set is defined. Much of analysis happens in some metric space the most commonly used are the real line , the complex plane , Euclidean space , other vector spaces , and the integers . Examples of analysis without a metric include measure theory which describes size rather than distance and functional analysis which studies topological vector spaces that need not have any sense of distance. Formally, a metric space is an ordered pair  M , d  displaystyle M,d where M displaystyle M is a set and d displaystyle d is a metric on M displaystyle M , i.e., a function d  M  M  R displaystyle dcolon Mtimes Mrightarrow mathbb R  such that for any x , y , z  M displaystyle x,y,zin M , the following holds d  x , y   0 displaystyle dx,y0 if and only if x  y displaystyle xy      identity of indiscernibles , d  x , y   d  y , x  displaystyle dx,ydy,x      symmetry , and d  x , z   d  x , y   d  y , z  displaystyle dx,zleq dx,ydy,z      triangle inequality . By taking the third property and letting z  x displaystyle zx , it can be shown that d  x , y   0 displaystyle dx,ygeq 0        non-negative . Sequences and limits  edit  Main article Sequence A sequence is an ordered list. Like a set , it contains members also called elements , or terms . Unlike a set, order matters, and exactly the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Most precisely, a sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is a countable totally ordered set, such as the natural numbers . One of the most important properties of a sequence is convergence . Informally, a sequence converges if it has a limit . Continuing informally, a  singly-infinite  sequence has a limit if it approaches some point x , called the limit, as n becomes very large. That is, for an abstract sequence  a n  with n running from 1 to infinity understood the distance between a n and x approaches 0 as n  , denoted lim n   a n  x . displaystyle lim _nto infty a_nx. Main branches  edit  Real analysis  edit  Main article Real analysis Real analysis traditionally, the theory of functions of a real variable  is a branch of mathematical analysis dealing with the real numbers and real-valued functions of a real variable. 13  14  In particular, it deals with the analytic properties of real functions and sequences , including convergence and limits of sequences of real numbers, the calculus of the real numbers, and continuity , smoothness and related properties of real-valued functions. Complex analysis  edit  Main article Complex analysis Complex analysis , traditionally known as the theory of functions of a complex variable , is the branch of mathematical analysis that investigates functions of complex numbers . 15  It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry , number theory , applied mathematics  as well as in physics , including hydrodynamics , thermodynamics , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , and particularly, quantum field theory . Complex analysis is particularly concerned with the analytic functions of complex variables or, more generally, meromorphic functions . Because the separate real and imaginary parts of any analytic function must satisfy Laplaces equation , complex analysis is widely applicable to two-dimensional problems in physics . Functional analysis  edit  Main article Functional analysis Functional analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis, the core of which is formed by the study of vector spaces endowed with some kind of limit-related structure e.g. inner product , norm , topology , etc. and the linear operators acting upon these spaces and respecting these structures in a suitable sense. 16  17  The historical roots of functional analysis lie in the study of spaces of functions and the formulation of properties of transformations of functions such as the Fourier transform as transformations defining continuous , unitary etc. operators between function spaces. This point of view turned out to be particularly useful for the study of differential and integral equations . Differential equations  edit  Main article Differential equations A differential equation is a mathematical equation for an unknown function of one or several variables that relates the values of the function itself and its derivatives of various orders . 18  19  20  Differential equations play a prominent role in engineering , physics , economics , biology , and other disciplines. Differential equations arise in many areas of science and technology, specifically whenever a deterministic relation involving some continuously varying quantities modeled by functions and their rates of change in space or time expressed as derivatives is known or postulated. This is illustrated in classical mechanics , where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newtons laws allow one given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In some cases, this differential equation called an equation of motion  may be solved explicitly. Measure theory  edit  Main article Measure mathematics A measure on a set is a systematic way to assign a number to each suitable subset of that set, intuitively interpreted as its size. 21  In this sense, a measure is a generalization of the concepts of length, area, and volume. A particularly important example is the Lebesgue measure on a Euclidean space , which assigns the conventional length , area , and volume of Euclidean geometry to suitable subsets of the n displaystyle n -dimensional Euclidean space R n displaystyle mathbb R n . For instance, the Lebesgue measure of the interval  0 , 1  displaystyle left0,1right in the real numbers is its length in the everyday sense of the word  specifically, 1. Technically, a measure is a function that assigns a non-negative real number or  to certain subsets of a set X displaystyle X . It must assign 0 to the empty set and be  countably  additive the measure of a large subset that can be decomposed into a finite or countable number of smaller disjoint subsets, is the sum of the measures of the smaller subsets. In general, if one wants to associate a consistent size to each subset of a given set while satisfying the other axioms of a measure, one only finds trivial examples like the counting measure . This problem was resolved by defining measure only on a sub-collection of all subsets the so-called measurable subsets, which are required to form a  displaystyle sigma  -algebra . This means that countable unions , countable intersections and complements of measurable subsets are measurable. Non-measurable sets in a Euclidean space, on which the Lebesgue measure cannot be defined consistently, are necessarily complicated in the sense of being badly mixed up with their complement. Indeed, their existence is a non-trivial consequence of the axiom of choice . Numerical analysis  edit  Main article Numerical analysis Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation as opposed to general symbolic manipulations  for the problems of mathematical analysis as distinguished from discrete mathematics . 22  Modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors. Numerical analysis naturally finds applications in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st  century, the life sciences and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. Ordinary differential equations appear in celestial mechanics planets, stars and galaxies numerical linear algebra is important for data analysis stochastic differential equations and Markov chains are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology. Other topics  edit  Calculus of variations deals with extremizing functionals , as opposed to ordinary calculus which deals with functions . Harmonic analysis deals with the representation of functions or signals as the superposition of basic waves . Geometric analysis involves the use of geometrical methods in the study of partial differential equations and the application of the theory of partial differential equations to geometry. Clifford analysis , the study of Clifford valued functions that are annihilated by Dirac or Dirac-like operators, termed in general as monogenic or Clifford analytic functions. p -adic analysis , the study of analysis within the context of p -adic numbers , which differs in some interesting and surprising ways from its real and complex counterparts. Non-standard analysis , which investigates the hyperreal numbers and their functions and gives a rigorous treatment of infinitesimals and infinitely large numbers. Computable analysis , the study of which parts of analysis can be carried out in a computable manner. Stochastic calculus  analytical notions developed for stochastic processes . Set-valued analysis  applies ideas from analysis and topology to set-valued functions. Convex analysis , the study of convex sets and functions. Idempotent analysis  analysis in the context of an idempotent semiring , where the lack of an additive inverse is compensated somewhat by the idempotent rule A    A    A. Tropical analysis  analysis of the idempotent semiring called the tropical semiring or max-plus algebra  min-plus algebra . Non-Newtonian calculus , alternatives to the classical calculus of Newton and Leibniz. Applications  edit  Techniques from analysis are also found in other areas such as Physical sciences  edit  The vast majority of classical mechanics , relativity , and quantum mechanics is based on applied analysis, and differential equations in particular. Examples of important differential equations include Newtons second law , the Schrdinger equation , and the Einstein field equations . Functional analysis is also a major factor in quantum mechanics . Signal processing  edit  When processing signals, such as audio , radio waves , light waves, seismic waves , and even images, Fourier analysis can isolate individual components of a compound waveform, concentrating them for easier detection or removal. A large family of signal processing techniques consist of Fourier-transforming a signal, manipulating the Fourier-transformed data in a simple way, and reversing the transformation. 23  Other areas of mathematics  edit  Techniques from analysis are used in many areas of mathematics, including Analytic number theory Analytic combinatorics Continuous probability Differential entropy in information theory Differential games Differential geometry , the application of calculus to specific mathematical spaces known as manifolds that possess a complicated internal structure but behave in a simple manner locally.
