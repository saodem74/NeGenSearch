Infobox  references Expanded polystyrene packaging A polystyrene yogurt container Bottom of a vacuum-formed cup fine details such as the glass and fork food contact materials symbol and the resin identification code symbol are easily molded Polystyrene  PS    p  l i  s t a r i n  is a synthetic aromatic hydrocarbon polymer made from the monomer styrene . 5  Polystyrene can be solid or foamed. General-purpose polystyrene is clear, hard, and rather brittle. It is an inexpensive resin per unit weight. It is a rather poor barrier to oxygen and water vapour and has a relatively low melting point. 6  Polystyrene is one of the most widely used plastics , the scale of its production being several million tonnes per year. 7  Polystyrene can be naturally transparent , but can be coloured with colourants. Uses include protective packaging such as packing peanuts and CD and DVD cases, containers, lids, bottles, trays, tumblers, disposable cutlery 6  and in the making of models. As a thermoplastic polymer, polystyrene is in a solid glassy state at room temperature but flows if heated above about 100  C, its glass transition temperature . It becomes rigid again when cooled. This temperature behaviour is exploited for extrusion as in Styrofoam  and also for molding and vacuum forming , since it can be cast into molds with fine detail. Under ASTM standards, polystyrene is regarded as not biodegradable. It is accumulating as a form of litter in the outside environment , particularly along shores and waterways, especially in its foam form, and in the Pacific Ocean. 8  Contents 1 History 2 Structure 2.1 Polymerization 2.1.1 Atactic polystyrene 2.1.2 Syndiotactic polystyrene 3 Degradation 3.1 Organisms 4 Forms produced 4.1 Sheet or molded polystyrene 4.2 Foams 4.2.1 Expanded polystyrene EPS 4.2.1.1 EPS in building construction 4.2.2 Extruded polystyrene XPS 4.2.3 Water absorption of polystyrene foams 4.3 Copolymers 4.4 Oriented polystyrene 5 Environmental issues 5.1 Production 5.2 Non-biodegradable 5.3 Litter 5.4 Reducing 5.4.1 United States 5.4.2 Outside the United States 5.5 Recycling 5.6 Incineration 6 Safety 6.1 Health 6.2 Fire hazards 7 See also 8 References 9 Bibliography 10 External links History  edit  Polystyrene was discovered in 1839 by Eduard Simon , an apothecary from Berlin. 9  From storax , the resin of the American sweetgum tree Liquidambar styraciflua , he distilled an oily substance, a monomer that he named styrol. Several days later, Simon found that the styrol had thickened into a jelly he dubbed styrol oxide Styroloxyd because he presumed an oxidation. By 1845 Jamaican-born chemist John Buddle Blyth and German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann showed that the same transformation of styrol took place in the absence of oxygen. 10  They called the product metastyrol analysis showed that it was chemically identical to Simons Styroloxyd. 11  In 1866 Marcelin Berthelot correctly identified the formation of metastyrolStyroloxyd from styrol as a polymerisation process. 12  About 80 years later it was realized that heating of styrol starts a chain reaction that produces macromolecules , following the thesis of German organic chemist Hermann Staudinger 18811965. This eventually led to the substance receiving its present name, polystyrene. The company I. G. Farben began manufacturing polystyrene in Ludwigshafen , about 1931, hoping it would be a suitable replacement for die-cast zinc in many applications. Success was achieved when they developed a reactor vessel that extruded polystyrene through a heated tube and cutter, producing polystyrene in pellet form.  citation needed  Otis Ray McIntire 1918-1996 a chemical engineer of Dow Chemical rediscovered a process first patented by Swedish inventor Carl Munters. 13  According to the Science History Institute, Dow bought the rights to Munterss method and began producing a lightweight, water-resistant, and buoyant material that seemed perfectly suited for building docks and watercraft and for insulating homes, offices, and chicken sheds. 14  In 1944, Styrofoam was patented. Before 1949, chemical engineer Fritz Stastny 19081985 developed pre-expanded PS beads by incorporating aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane. These beads are the raw material for moulding parts or extruding sheets. BASF and Stastny applied for a patent that was issued in 1949. The moulding process was demonstrated at the Kunststoff Messe 1952 in Dsseldorf. Products were named Styropor. The crystal structure of isotactic polystyrene was reported by Giulio Natta . 15  In 1954, the Koppers Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , developed expanded polystyrene EPS foam under the trade name Dylite. 16  In 1960, Dart Container , the largest manufacturer of foam cups, shipped their first order. 17  Structure  edit  Polystyrene is flammable , and releases high amounts of black smoke upon burning. In chemical terms, polystyrene is a long chain hydrocarbon wherein alternating carbon centers are attached to phenyl groups a derivative of benzene . Polystyrenes chemical formula is C 8 H 8  n  it contains the chemical elements carbon and hydrogen . The materials properties are determined by short-range van der Waals attractions between polymers chains. Since the molecules consist of thousands of atoms, the cumulative attractive force between the molecules is large. When heated or deformed at a rapid rate, due to a combination of viscoelastic and thermal insulation properties, the chains are able to take on a higher degree of conformation and slide past each other. This intermolecular weakness versus the high intramolecular strength due to the hydrocarbon backbone confers flexibility and elasticity. The ability of the system to be readily deformed above its glass transition temperature allows polystyrene and thermoplastic polymers in general to be readily softened and molded upon heating. Extruded polystyrene is about as strong as an unalloyed aluminium but much more flexible and much less dense 1.05 gcm 3 for polystyrene vs. 2.70 gcm 3 for aluminium. Polymerization  edit  Polystyrene results when styrene monomers interconnect. In the polymerisation, the carboncarbon  bond of the vinyl group is broken and a new carboncarbon  bond is formed, attaching to the carbon of another styrene monomer to the chain. The newly formed  bond is stronger than the  bond that was broken, thus it is difficult to depolymerize polystyrene. About a few thousand monomers typically comprise a chain of polystyrene, giving a molecular weight of 100,000400,000 gmol. Each carbon of the backbone has tetrahedral geometry , and those carbons that have a phenyl group benzene ring attached are stereogenic . If the backbone were to be laid as a flat elongated zig-zag chain, each phenyl group would be tilted forward or backward compared to the plane of the chain. The relative stereochemical relationship of consecutive phenyl groups determines the tacticity , which has an effect on various physical properties of the material. The diastereomer where all of the phenyl groups are on the same side is called isotactic polystyrene, which is not produced commercially. Atactic polystyrene  edit  The only commercially important form of polystyrene is atactic , in which the phenyl groups are randomly distributed on both sides of the polymer chain. This random positioning prevents the chains from aligning with sufficient regularity to achieve any crystallinity . The plastic has a glass transition temperature T g of 90  C. Polymerisation is initiated with free radicals . 7  Syndiotactic polystyrene  edit  ZieglerNatta polymerization can produce an ordered syndiotactic polystyrene with the phenyl groups positioned on alternating sides of the hydrocarbon backbone. This form is highly crystalline with a T m of 270  C 518  F. Syndiotactic polystyrene resin is currently produced under the trade name XAREC by Idemitsu corporation, who use a metallocene catalyst for the polymerisation reaction. 18  Degradation  edit  Polystyrene is relatively chemically inert. While it is waterproof, and resistant to breakdown by many acids and bases, it is easily attacked by many organic solvents e.g. it dissolves quickly when exposed to acetone , chlorinated solvents, and aromatic hydrocarbon solvents. Because of its resilience and inertness, it is used for fabricating many objects of commerce. Like other organic compounds, polystyrene burns to give carbon dioxide and water vapor , in addition to other thermal degradation byproducts. Polystyrene, being an aromatic hydrocarbon , typically combusts incompletely as indicated by the sooty flame. The process of depolymerizing polystyrene into its monomer , styrene , is called pyrolysis . This involves using high heat and pressure to break down the chemical bonds between each styrene compound. Pyrolysis usually goes up to 430C. 19  Organisms  edit  Polystyrene is generally considered to be non-biodegradable. However, certain organisms are able to degrade it, albeit very slowly. 20  In 2015, researchers discovered that mealworms , the larvae form of the darkling beetle Tenebrio molitor , could digest and subsist healthily on a diet of EPS. 21  22  About 100 mealworms could consume between 34 and 39 milligrams of this white foam in a day. The droppings of mealworm were found to be safe for use as soil for crops. 21  Superworms  Zophobas morio  are also reported to eat EPS. 23  Pseudomonas putida is capable of converting styrene oil into the biodegradable plastic PHA . 24  25  26  This may someday be of use in the effective disposing of polystyrene foam. It is worthy to note the polystyrene must undergo pyrolysis to turn into styrene oil.

Polystyrene copolymers are also produced these contain one or more other monomers in addition to styrene. In recent years the expanded polystyrene composites with cellulose 30  31  and starch 32  have also been produced. Polystyrene is used in some polymer-bonded explosives PBX. Sheet or molded polystyrene  edit  CD case made from general purpose polystyrene GPPS and high impact polystyrene HIPS Disposable polystyrene razor Polystyrene PS is used for producing disposable plastic cutlery and dinnerware, CD jewel cases , smoke detector housings, license plate frames, plastic model assembly kits, and many other objects where a rigid, economical plastic is desired.  citation needed  Production methods include thermoforming  vacuum forming  and injection molding . Polystyrene Petri dishes and other laboratory containers such as test tubes and microplates play an important role in biomedical research and science. For these uses, articles are almost always made by injection molding, and often sterilised post-molding, either by irradiation or by treatment with ethylene oxide . Post-mold surface modification, usually with oxygen -rich plasmas , is often done to introduce polar groups. Much of modern biomedical research relies on the use of such products they therefore play a critical role in pharmaceutical research. 33  Thin sheets of polystyrene are used in polystyrene film capacitors as it forms a very stable dielectric , but has largely fallen out of use in favor of polyester . Foams  edit  Closeup of expanded polystyrene packaging Polystyrene foams are 95-98 air. 34  35  Polystyrene foams are good thermal insulators and are therefore often used as building insulation materials, such as in insulating concrete forms and structural insulated panel building systems. Grey polystyrene foam, incorporating graphite has superior insulation properties. 36  PS foams also exhibit good damping properties, therefore it is used widely in packaging. The trademark Styrofoam by Dow Chemical Company is informally used mainly US  Canada for all foamed polystyrene products, although strictly it should only be used for extruded closed-cell polystyrene foams made by Dow Chemicals. Foams are also used for non-weight-bearing architectural structures such as ornamental pillars . Expanded polystyrene EPS  edit  Thermocol slabs made of expanded polystyrene EPS beads. The one on the left is from a packing box. The one on the right is used for crafts. It has a corky, papery texture and is used for stage decoration, exhibition models, and sometimes as a cheap alternative to Shola  Aeschynomene aspera  stems for artwork. Section of a block of thermocol under a light microscope  bright-field , objective  10, eye piece  15. The larger spheres are expanded polystyrene beads which were compressed and fused together. The bright, star-shaped hole at the center of the image is an air-gap between the beads where the bead margins have not completely fused. Each bead is made of thin-walled, air-filled bubbles of polystyrene. Expanded polystyrene EPS is a rigid and tough, closed-cell foam with a normal density range of 11 to 32  kgm 3 . 37  It is usually white and made of pre-expanded polystyrene beads. EPS is used for food containers , molded sheets for building insulation , and packing material either as solid blocks formed to accommodate the item being protected or as loose-fill peanuts cushioning fragile items inside boxes. A significant portion of all EPS products are manufactured through injection molding. Mold tools tend to be manufactured from steels which can be hardened and plated, and aluminum alloys. The molds are controlled through a split via a channel system of gates and runners. 38  EPS is colloquially called styrofoam in the United States and Canada, an incorrectly applied genericization of Dow Chemicals brand of extruded polystyrene . 39  EPS in building construction  edit  Sheets of EPS are commonly packaged as rigid panels Common in Europe is a size of 100cmx50cm, usually depending on an intended type of connection and glue techniques, it is in fact 99.5cmx49.5cm or 98cmx48cm less common is 120x60cm   size 4 by 8 or 2 by 8 feet in the United States. Common thicknesses are from 10mm to 500mm. Many customization, additives and thin additional external layers on one or both sides, are often added to help with various properties. Thermal conductivity is measured according to EN 12667. Typical values range from 0.032 to 0.038 WmK depending on the density of the EPS board. The value of 0.038 WmK was obtained at 15  kgm 3 while the value of 0.032 WmK was obtained at 40  kgm 3 according to the data sheet of K-710 from StyroChem Finland. Adding fillers graphites, aluminium, or carbons has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.0300.034 as low as 0.029 and as such has a greyblack colour which distinguishes it from standard EPS. Several EPS producers have produced a variety of these increased thermal resistance EPS usage for this product in the UK  EU. Water vapor diffusion resistance  of EPS is around 3070. ICC-ES International Code Council Evaluation Service requires EPS boards used in building construction meet ASTM C578 requirements. One of these requirements is that the oxygen index of EPS as measured by ASTM D2863 be greater than 24 volume  . Typical EPS has an oxygen index of around 18 volume   thus, a flame retardant is added to styrene or polystyrene during the formation of EPS. The boards containing a flame retardant when tested in a tunnel using test method UL 723 or ASTM E84 will have a flame spread index of less than 25 and a smoke-developed index of less than 450. ICC-ES requires the use of a 15-minute thermal barrier when EPS boards are used inside of a building. According to EPS-IA ICF organization, the typical density of EPS used for insulated concrete forms is 1.35 to 1.80 pcf. This is either Type II or Type IX EPS according to ASTM C578. EPS blocks or boards used in building construction are commonly cut using hot wires. 40  Extruded polystyrene XPS  edit  See also Styrofoam Extruded polystyrene foam XPS consists of closed cells. It offers improved surface roughness, higher stiffness and reduced thermal conductivity. The density range is about 2845  kgm 3 . Extruded polystyrene material is also used in crafts and model building, in particular architectural models. Because of the extrusion manufacturing process, XPS does not require facers to maintain its thermal or physical property performance. Thus, it makes a more uniform substitute for corrugated cardboard . Thermal conductivity varies between 0.029 and 0.039 WmK depending on bearing strengthdensity and the average value is 0.035 WmK. Water vapour diffusion resistance  of XPS is around 80250. Water absorption of polystyrene foams  edit  Although it is a closed-cell foam, both expanded and extruded polystyrene are not entirely waterproof or vaporproof. 41  In expanded polystyrene there are interstitial gaps between the expanded closed-cell pellets that form an open network of channels between the bonded pellets, and this network of gaps can become filled with liquid water. If the water freezes into ice, it expands and can cause polystyrene pellets to break off from the foam. Extruded polystyrene is also permeable by water molecules and can not be considered a vapor barrier. 42  Waterlogging commonly occurs over a long period of time in polystyrene foams that are constantly exposed to high humidity or are continuously immersed in water, such as in hot tub covers, in floating docks, as supplemental flotation under boat seats, and for below-grade exterior building insulation constantly exposed to groundwater. 43  Typically an exterior vapor barrier such as impermeable plastic sheeting or a sprayed-on coating is necessary to prevent saturation. Copolymers  edit  Pure polystyrene is brittle , but hard enough that a fairly high-performance product can be made by giving it some of the properties of a stretchier material, such as polybutadiene rubber. The two such materials can never normally be mixed because of the small mixing entropy of polymers see Flory-Huggins solution theory , but if polybutadiene is added during polymerisation it can become chemically bonded to the polystyrene, forming a graft copolymer ,  citation needed  which helps to incorporate normal polybutadiene into the final mix, resulting in high-impact polystyrene or HIPS , often called high-impact plastic in advertisements. One commercial name for HIPS is Bextrene. Common applications of HIPS include toys and product casings. HIPS is usually injection molded in production. Autoclaving polystyrene can compress and harden the material. Several other copolymers are also used with styrene. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or ABS plastic is similar to HIPS a copolymer of a crylonitrile and s tyrene, toughened with poly b utadiene. Most electronics cases are made of this form of polystyrene, as are many sewer pipes. SAN is a copolymer of styrene with acrylonitrile , and SMA one with maleic anhydride . Styrene can be copolymerized with other monomers for example, divinylbenzene can be used for cross-linking the polystyrene chains to give the polymer used in Solid phase peptide synthesis . Oriented polystyrene  edit  Oriented polystyrene OPS is produced by stretching extruded PS film, improving visibility through the material by reducing haziness and increasing stiffness. This is often used in packaging where the manufacturer would like the consumer to see the enclosed product. Some benefits to OPS are that it is less expensive to produce than other clear plastics such as polypropylene PP, polyethylene terephthalate PET, and high-impact polystyrene HIPS, and it is less hazy than HIPS or PP. The main disadvantage to OPS is that it is brittle, and will crack or tear easily. Environmental issues  edit  Production  edit  Polystyrene foams are produced using blowing agents that form bubbles and expand the foam. In expanded polystyrene, these are usually hydrocarbons such as pentane , which may pose a flammability hazard in manufacturing or storage of newly manufactured material, but have relatively mild environmental impact.  citation needed  Extruded polystyrene is usually made with hydrofluorocarbons  HFC-134a , 44  which have global warming potentials of approximately 10001300 times that of carbon dioxide. 45  Non-biodegradable  edit  Discarded polystyrene does not biodegrade for hundreds of years and is resistant to photo-oxidation . 46  Litter  edit  Polystyrene waste Coastal debris including polystyrene Animals do not recognize polystyrene foam as an artificial material and may even mistake it for food. 47  Polystyrene foam blows in the wind and floats on water, due to its low specific gravity. It can have serious effects on the health of birds or marine animals that swallow significant quantities. 47  Reducing  edit  Restricting the use of foamed polystyrene takeout food packaging is a priority of many solid waste environmental organisations . 48  Efforts have been made to find alternatives to polystyrene, especially foam in restaurant settings. The original impetus was to eliminate chlorofluorocarbons CFC, which was a former component of foam. United States  edit  In 1987, Berkeley, California , banned CFC food containers. 49  The following year, Suffolk County, New York , became the first U.S. jurisdiction to ban polystyrene in general. 50  However, legal challenges by the Society of the Plastics Industry 51  kept the ban from going into effect until at last it was delayed when the Republican and Conservative parties gained the majority of the county legislature. 52  In the meantime, Berkeley became the first city to ban all foam food containers. 53  As of 2006, about one hundred localities in the United States, including Portland, Oregon , and San Francisco had some sort of ban on polystyrene foam in restaurants. For instance, in 2007 Oakland, California , required restaurants to switch to disposable food containers that would biodegrade if added to food compost. 54  In 2013, San Jose became reportedly the largest city in the country to ban polystyrene foam food containers. 55  Some communities have implemented wide polystyrene bans, such as Freeport, Maine , which did so in 1990. 56  In 1988, the first U.S. ban of general polystyrene foam was enacted in Berkeley, California. 53  On July 1, 2015, New York City became the largest city in the United States to attempt to prohibit the sale, possession and distribution of single-use polystyrene foam the initial decision was overturned on appeal. 57  In San Francisco, supervisors approved the toughest ban on Styrofoam EPS in the US which went into effect January 1, 2017. The citys Department of the Environment can make exceptions for certain uses like shipping medicines at prescribed temperatures. 58  The U.S. Green Restaurant Association does not allow polystyrene foam to be used as part of its certification standard. 59  Several green leaders, from the Dutch Ministry of the Environment to Starbucks s Green Team, advise people to reduce their environmental harm by using reusable coffee cups. 60  In March 2019, Maryland banned polystyrene foam food containers and became the first state in the country to pass a food container foam ban through the state legislature. Maine was the first state to officially get a foam food container ban onto the books. In May 2019, Maryland Governor Hogan allowed the foam ban House Bill 109 to become law without a signature making Maryland the second state to have a food container foam ban on the books, but is the first one to take effect on July 1st 2020. 61  62  63  64  Outside the United States  edit  China banned expanded polystyrene takeouttakeaway containers and tableware around 1999. However, compliance has been a problem and, in 2013, the Chinese plastics industry was lobbying for the bans repeal. 65  India and Taiwan also banned polystyrene-foam food-service ware before 2007. 66  The government of Zimbabwe , through its Environmental Management Agency EMA, banned polystyrene containers popularly called kaylite in the country, under Statutory Instrument 84 of 2012 Plastic Packaging and Plastic Bottles Amendment Regulations, 2012 No 1. 67  68  The city of Vancouver , Canada, has announced its Zero Waste 2040 plan in 2018. The city will introduce bylaw amendments to prohibit business license holders from serving prepared food in polystyrene foam cups and take-out containers, beginning 1 June 2019. 69  Recycling  edit  The resin identification code symbol for polystyrene In general, polystyrene is not accepted in curbside collection recycling programmes, and is not separated and recycled where it is accepted. In Germany, polystyrene is collected, as a consequence of the packaging law Verpackungsverordnung that requires manufacturers to take responsibility for recycling or disposing of any packaging material they sell. Most polystyrene products are currently not recycled due to the lack of incentive to invest in the compactors and logistical systems required. Due to the low density of polystyrene foam, it is not economical to collect. However, if the waste material goes through an initial compaction process, the material changes density from typically 30  kgm 3 to 330  kgm 3 and becomes a recyclable commodity of high value for producers of recycled plastic pellets. Expanded polystyrene scrap can be easily added to products such as EPS insulation sheets and other EPS materials for construction applications many manufacturers cannot obtain sufficient scrap because of collection issues. When it is not used to make more EPS, foam scrap can be turned into products such as clothes hangers, park benches, flower pots, toys, rulers, stapler bodies, seedling containers, picture frames, and architectural molding from recycled PS. 70  As of 2016, around 100 tonnes of EPS are recycled every month in the UK. 71  Recycled EPS is also used in many metal casting operations. Rastra is made from EPS that is combined with cement to be used as an insulating amendment in the making of concrete foundations and walls. American manufacturers have produced insulating concrete forms made with approximately 80 recycled EPS since 1993. Incineration  edit  If polystyrene is properly incinerated at high temperatures up to 1000  C 72   and with plenty of air 72  14 m 3 kg  citation needed  , the chemicals generated are water, carbon dioxide, and possibly small amounts of residual halogen-compounds from flame-retardants. 72  If only incomplete incineration is done, there will also be leftover carbon soot and a complex mixture of volatile compounds. 73   better  source  needed  According to the American Chemistry Council , when polystyrene is incinerated in modern facilities, the final volume is 1 of the starting volume most of the polystyrene is converted into carbon dioxide, water vapor, and heat. Because of the amount of heat released, it is sometimes used as a power source for steam or electricity generation . 72  74  When polystyrene was burned at temperatures of 800900  C the typical range of a modern incinerator, the products of combustion consisted of a complex mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs from alkyl benzenes to benzoperylene. Over 90 different compounds were identified in combustion effluents from polystyrene. 75   better  source  needed  The American National Bureau of Standards Center for Fire Research found 57 chemical by-products released during the combustion of expanded polystyrene EPS foam. 76  Safety  edit  Health  edit  According to a plastic food service products website of the American Chemistry Council  .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 Based on scientific tests over five decades, government safety agencies have determined that polystyrene may be safe for use in foodservice products. For example, polystyrene comes close to meeting the standards of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European CommissionEuropean Food Safety Authority for use in packaging to store and serve food. The Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department recently reviewed the safety of serving various foods in polystyrene foodservice products and reached the same conclusion as the U.S. FDA. 77  From 1999 to 2002, a comprehensive review of the potential health risks associated with exposure to styrene was conducted by a 12-member international expert panel selected by the Harvard Center for Risk Assessment. The scientists had expertise in toxicology, epidemiology, medicine, risk analysis, pharmacokinetics, and exposure assessment. The Harvard study reported that styrene is naturally present in trace quantities in foods such as strawberries, beef, and spices, and is naturally produced in the processing of foods such as wine and cheese. The study also reviewed all the published data on the quantity of styrene contributing to the diet due to migration of food packaging and disposable food contact articles, and concluded there is cause for limited concern for the general public from exposure to styrene from foods or styrenic materials used in food-contact applications, such as polystyrene packaging and food service containers, especially after microwaving. 78  Polystyrene is commonly used in containers for food and drinks. The styrene monomer from which polystyrene is made is a cancer suspect agent. 79  Styrene is generally found in such low levels in consumer products that risks arent substantial. 80  Polystyrene which is used for food contact may not contain more than 1 0.5 for fatty foods of styrene by weight. 81  Styrene oligomers in polystyrene containers used for food packaging have been found to migrate into the food. 82  Another Japanese study conducted on wild-type and AhR -null mice found that the styrene trimer, which the authors detected in cooked polystyrene container-packed instant foods, may increase thyroid hormone levels. 83  Whether polystyrene can be microwaved with food is controversial. Some containers may be safely used in a microwave, but only if labelled as such. 84  Some sources suggest that foods containing carotene vitamin A or cooking oils must be avoided. 85  Because of the pervasive use of polystyrene, these serious health related issues remain topical. 86  Fire hazards  edit  Like other organic compounds , polystyrene is flammable. Polystyrene is classified according to DIN4102 as a B3 product, meaning highly flammable or Easily Ignited. As a consequence, although it is an efficient insulator at low temperatures, its use is prohibited in any exposed installations in building construction if the material is not flame-retardant .  citation needed  It must be concealed behind drywall , sheet metal, or concrete. 87  Foamed polystyrene plastic materials have been accidentally ignited and caused huge fires and losses of life, for example at the Dsseldorf International Airport and the Channel tunnel where polystyrene was inside a railcar that caught fire. 88  See also  edit  Styrofoam  brand of extruded polystyrene foam Foam food container Bioplastic Geofoam Structural insulated panel Polystyrene sulfonate References  edit   Wypych, George 2012.

From p. 312 Analyse sowohl als Synthese haben in gleicher Weise dargethan, dass Styrol und die feste glasartige Materie, fr welche wir den Namen Metastyrol vorschlagen, dieselbe procentische Zusammensetzung besitzen. Analysis as well as synthesis have equally demonstrated, that styrol and the solid, glassy material, for which we suggest the name metastyrol, possess the same percentage composition.  Berthelot, M. 1866 Sur les caractres de la benzine et du styrolne, compars avec ceux des autres carbures dhydrogne On the characters of benzene and styrene, compared with those of other hydrocarbons, Bulletin de la Socit Chimique de Paris , 2nd series, 6   289298. From p. 294 On sait que le stryolne chauff en vase scell  200, pendant quelques heures, se change en un polymre rsineux mtastyrol, et que ce polymre, distill brusquement, reproduit le styrolne. One knows that styrene when heated in a sealed vessel at 200C, for several hours, is changed into a resinous polymer polystyrene, and that this polymer, when distilled abruptly, reproduces styrene.
