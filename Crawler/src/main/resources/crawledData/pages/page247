Melissa Russell Executive Director. Employees 47 Website www .computer .org IEEE Computer Society sometimes abbreviated Computer Society or CS  is a professional society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE. Its purpose and scope is to advance the theory, practice, and application of computer and information processing science and technology and the professional standing of its members. 2  The CS is the largest of 39 technical societies organized under the IEEE Technical Activities Board . 3  The IEEE Computer Society sponsors workshops and conferences, publishes a variety of peer-reviewed literature, operates technical committees, and develops IEEE computing standards. 4  It supports more than 200 chapters worldwide 5  and participates in educational activities at all levels of the profession, including distance learning, accreditation of higher education programs in computer science, and professional certification in software engineering. 3  The IEEE Computer Society is also a member organization of the Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of Enterprise Architecture .

The IEEE Computer Society traces its origins to the Subcommittee on Large-Scale Computing, established in 1946 by the American Institute of Electrical Engineers  AIEE , 6  and to the Professional Group on Electronic Computers PGEC, established in 1951 by the Institute of Radio Engineers IRE. 7  When the AIEE merged with the IRE in 1963 to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE, these two committees became the IEEE Computer Group. 8  The group established its own constitution and bylaws in 1971 to become the IEEE Computer Society. 1  The CS maintains its headquarters in Washington, D.C. and additional offices in California, China, and Japan. 9  Main activities  edit  IEEE Computer Society publications office in Los Alamitos, California The IEEE Computer Society maintains volunteer boards in six program areas education, membership, professional activities, publications, standards, and technical and conference activities. In addition, 12 standing committees administer activities such as the CS elections and its awards programs to recognize professional excellence. 10  Education and professional development  edit  The IEEE Computer Society participates in ongoing development of college computing curricula, jointly with the Association for Computing Machinery ACM. 11  Other educational activities include software development certification programs 12  and online access to e-learning courseware and books. 13  Publications  edit  The IEEE Computer Society is a leading publisher of technical material in computing. 14  Its publications include 12 peer-reviewed technical magazines and 20 scholarly journals called Transactions , as well as conference proceedings, books, and a variety of digital products. 15  The Computer Society Digital Library CSDL is the crown jewel of the Computer Societys digital assets and provides subscriber access to all CS publications, as well as conference proceedings and other papers, amounting to more than 700,000 pieces of content. 16  As most publications were delivered digitally in 2014, the IEEE Computer Society launched the complementary monthly digest Computing Edge magazine, which consists of curated articles from its magazines. 17  Technical conferences and activities  edit  Steve Wozniak relating tales of his television jammer hijinks from college at the first TechIgnite conference The IEEE Computer Society sponsors more than 170 technical conferences each year 18  and coordinates the operation of several technical committees, councils, and task forces. 19  The IEEE Computer Society also maintains 12 standards committees to develop IEEE standards in various areas of computer and software engineering e.g., the Design Automation Standards Committee and the IEEE 802 LANMAN Standards Committee. 20  In 2010, the IEEE Computer Society introduced Special Technical Communities STCs as a new way for members to develop communities focusing on selected technical areas. 21  Current topics include broadening participation, cloud computing, education, eGov, haptics, multicore, operating systems, smart grids, social networking, sustainable computing, systems engineering, and wearable and ubiquitous technologies. 22  Technical committees  edit  The IEEE Computer Society currently has 31 technical committees and two technical councils. 23  A technical committee TC is an international network of professionals with common interests in computer hardware, software, its applications, and interdisciplinary fields within the umbrella of the IEEE Computer Society. A technical council is essentially a very large technical committee, and a task force is an emerging technical committee. A TC serves as the focal point of the various technical activities within a technical discipline which influences the standards development, conferences, publications, and educational activities of the IEEE Computer Society. Following are the current technical committees and councils Technical Committee on Business Informatics and Systems TCBIS Technical Committee on Computer Architecture TCCA Technical Committee on Computational Life Sciences TCCLS Technical Committee on Computer Communications TCCC Technical Committee on Data Engineering TCDE Technical Committee on Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance TCFT Technical Committee on Digital Libraries TCDL Technical Committee on Distributed Processing TCDP Technical Committee on Intelligent Informatics TCII Technical Committee on Internet TCI Technical Committee on Learning Technology TCLT Technical Committee on Mathematical Foundations of Computing TCMF Technical Committee on Microprocessors and Microcomputers TCMM Technical Committee on Microprogramming and Microarchitecture TCuARCH Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing TCMC Technical Committee on Multiple-Valued Logic TCMVL Technical Committee on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence TCPAMI Technical Committee on Parallel Processing TCPP Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems TCRTS Technical Committee on Scalable Computing TCSC Technical Committee on Security and Privacy TCSP Technical Committee on Semantic Computing TCSEM Technical Committee on Services Computing TCSVC Technical Committee on Simulation TCSIM Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics VGTC Technical Committee on VLSI 24  TCVLSI Technical Council on Software Engineering TCSE Technical Council on Test Technology TTTC Awards  edit  The IEEE Computer Society recognizes outstanding work by computer professionals who advance the field in three areas of achievement Technical Awards e.g., the Seymour Cray Computer Engineering Award or the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award , Education Awards e.g., Taylor L. Booth Education Award , and Service Awards e.g., Richard E. Merwin Distinguished Service Award. 25  In 2018, the organization won First Place in the Los Angeles Press Clubs annual Southern California Journalism Awards for Untold Stories Setting the Record Straight on Techs Racial History,  by digital editor Michael Martinez and senior writer Lori Cameron, in the minorityimmigration reporting online category. The awards saw record entries from around the world in 2018 from the biggest publishing, broadcasting, online, and media outlets.
