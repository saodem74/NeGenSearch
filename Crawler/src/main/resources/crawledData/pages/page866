Industry From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about industry in relation to economics. For other uses, see Industry disambiguation . Cement factories are part of the manufacturing industry. This factory is in Malm, Sweden. An industry is a sector that produces goods or related services within an economy . 1  The major source of revenue of a group or company is an indicator of what industry it should be classified in. 2  When a large corporate group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries. The manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution , upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies. This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the development of steam power and the production of steel and coal . Following the Industrial Revolution, possibly a third of the economic output came from manufacturing industries. Many developed countries and many developingsemi-developed countries China, India etc. depend significantly on manufacturing industry.

It typically produces goods for which profit depends on economies of scale , especially those for which labor was simple and easy to supervise. 4  International law has declared slavery illegal. 5  Guilds  edit  Main article Guild Guilds, associations of artisan s and merchants , oversee the production and distribution of a particular good. Guilds have their roots in the Roman Empire as collegia singular collegium  Membership in these early guilds was voluntary. The Roman collegia did not survive the fall of Rome. 6  In the early middle ages , guilds once again began to emerge in Europe, reaching a degree of maturity by the beginning of the 14th century. 7   need quotation to verify  While few guilds remain today update  , some modern labor structures resemble those of traditional guilds. 8  Other guilds, such as the SAG-AFTRA act as trade union s rather than as classical guilds. Professor Sheilagh Ogilvie claims that guilds negatively affected quality, skills, and innovation in areas that they were present. 9  Industrial Revolution  edit  Main article Industrial Revolution The industrial revolution from the mid-18th century to the mid-19th century saw the development and popularization of mechanized means of production as a replacement for hand production. 10  The industrial revolution played a role in the abolition of slavery in Europe and in North America. 11  Since the Industrial Revolution  edit  This section needs expansion .

Here is a thermal oxidizer during the industrial shipping process. A factory, a traditional symbol of the industrial development a cement factory in Kunda, Estonia  The Industrial Revolution led to the development of factories for large-scale production with consequent changes in society. 12  Originally the factories were steam-powered, but later transitioned to electricity once an electrical grid was developed. The mechanized assembly line was introduced to assemble parts in a repeatable fashion, with individual workers performing specific steps during the process. This led to significant increases in efficiency, lowering the cost of the end process. Later automation was increasingly used to replace human operators. This process has accelerated with the development of the computer and the robot . Deindustrialisation  edit  Main article Deindustrialisation Colin Clark s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the Quaternary sector of the economy grows. Historically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors, including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage. An example of the former is the decline in carriage manufacturing when the automobile was mass-produced. A recent trend has been the migration of prosperous, industrialized nations towards a post-industrial society . This is manifested by an increase in the service sector at the expense of manufacturing, and the development of an information-based economy, the so-called informational revolution . In a post-industrial society, manufacturers relocate to more profitable locations through a process of off-shoring . Measurements of manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect are not historically stable. Traditionally, success has been measured in the number of jobs created. The reduced number of employees in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to result from a decline in the competitiveness of the sector, or the introduction of the lean manufacturing process. Related to this change is the upgrading of the quality of the product being manufactured. While it is possible to produce a low-technology product with low-skill labour, the ability to manufacture high-technology products well is dependent on a highly skilled staff. Society  edit  Main article Industrial society An industrial society is a society driven by the use of technology to enable mass production , supporting a large population with a high capacity for division of labour . Today, industry is an important part of most societies and nations. A government must have some kind of industrial policy , regulating industrial placement, industrial pollution , financing and industrial labour . Industrial labour  edit  An industrial worker amidst heavy steel components KINEX BEARINGS, Byta , Slovakia , c. 19952000 Main article Industrial labour Further information industrial sociology , industrial and organizational psychology , industrial district , and industrial park In an industrial society, industry employs a major part of the population. This occurs typically in the manufacturing sector. A labour union is an organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas such as wages, hours, and other working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members  rank and file members and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This movement first rose among industrial workers. War  edit  Main article Industrial warfare The assembly plant of the Bell Aircraft Corporation  Wheatfield, New York , United States, 1944 producing P-39 Airacobra fighters The Industrial Revolution changed warfare, with mass-produced weaponry and supplies, machine-powered transportation, mobilization , the total war concept and weapons of mass destruction .

The proved institutional mechanisms for this negotiation were the license, the qualifying examination, the diploma, and formal training in a common curriculum. The typical institutions that administered these devices were, first, the guild-like professional association, and later the professional school, which superseded the association in effectiveness. ...

As the Industrial Revolution proceeded, the main focus of economic attention shifted to the new industries created by Britains technological prominence. These industries looked not for protection but for an opening of export markets. As the political economy shifted, the West Indian interest became vulnerable to their opponents.
