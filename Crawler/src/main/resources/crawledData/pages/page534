Schedule project management From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search In project management , a schedule is a listing of a project s milestones , activities , and deliverables , usually with intended start and finish dates. Those items are often estimated by other information included in the project schedule of resource allocation , budget , task duration , and linkages of dependencies and scheduled events. A schedule is commonly used in the project planning and project portfolio management parts of project management . Elements on a schedule may be closely related to the work breakdown structure WBS terminal elements , the Statement of work , or a Contract Data Requirements List .

The techniques of scheduling are well developed 1  but inconsistently applied throughout industry. Standardization and promotion of scheduling best practices are being pursued by the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering AACE, the Project Management Institute PMI, 2  and the US Government for acquisition 3  and accounting 4  purposes. Project management is not limited to industry the average person can use it to organize their own life. Some examples are Homeowner renovation project Keeping track of all the family activities Coaching a team Planning a vacation Planning a wedding Some project management software programs provide templates, lists, and example schedules to help their users with creating their schedule. Methods  edit  Before a project schedule can be created, the schedule maker should have a work breakdown structure WBS, an effort estimate for each task, and a resource list with availability for each resource . If these components for the schedule are not available, they can be created with a consensus-driven estimation method like Wideband Delphi . The reason for this is that a schedule itself is an estimate each date in the schedule is estimated, and if those dates do not have the buy-in of the people who are going to do the work, the schedule will be inaccurate. 5  To develop a project schedule, the following needs to be completed 6  Project scope Sequence of activities Tasks grouped into 5 project phases conception, definition  planning, launch, performance, close Task dependencies map Critical path analysis Project milestones In order for a project schedule to be healthy, the following criteria must be met 7  The schedule must be constantly weekly works best updated. The EAC Estimation at Completion value must be equal to the baseline value. The remaining effort must be appropriately distributed among team members taking vacations into consideration. The schedule structure may closely follow and include citations to the index of work breakdown structure or deliverables, using decomposition or templates to describe the activities needed to produce the deliverables defined in the WBS. 8  A schedule may be assessed for the quality of the schedule development and the quality of the schedule management. 9  10  11  See also  edit  Arrow diagramming method Gantt chart Integrated Master Schedule IMS List of project management software Precedence diagram method Project planning Project Portfolio Management Resource allocation Resource-Task Network Risk Management Scheduling References  edit   A Brief History of Scheduling PDF  Project Management Institute 2003.
