Ole-Johan Dahl From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Ole-Johan Dahl Born  1931-10-12  12 October 1931 Mandal , Norway Died 29 June 2002 2002-06-29 aged  70 Asker , Norway Known  for Simula Object-oriented programming Awards Turing Award 2001 IEEE John von Neumann Medal 2002 Scientific career Fields Computer Science Institutions Norwegian Computing Center University of Oslo Ole-Johan Dahl 12 October 1931  29 June 2002 was a Norwegian computer scientist . Dahl was a professor of computer science at the University of Oslo and is considered to be one of the fathers of Simula and object-oriented programming along with Kristen Nygaard . 1  2  Contents 1 Career 2 Early papers 3 See also 4 References 5 Sources 6 External links Career  edit  Dahl was born in Mandal , Norway. He was the son of Finn Dahl 18981962 and Ingrid Othilie Kathinka Pedersen 190580. When he was seven, his family moved to Drammen . When he was thirteen, the whole family fled to Sweden during the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany . After the end of the war, Dahl studied numerical mathematics at the University of Oslo. 3  Dahl became a full professor at the University of Oslo in 1968 and was a gifted teacher as well as researcher. Here he worked on Hierarchical Program Structures , probably his most influential publication, which appeared co-authored with C.A.R. Hoare in the influential book Structured Programming of 1972 by Dahl, Edsger Dijkstra and Hoare, perhaps the best-known academic book concerning software in the 1970s. As his career progressed, Dahl became increasingly interested in the use of formal methods , to rigorously reason about object-orientation for example. His expertise ranged from the practical application of ideas to their formal mathematical underpinning to ensure the validity of the approach. 4  Dahl is widely accepted as Norways foremost computer scientist. With Kristen Nygaard, he produced the initial ideas for object-oriented OO programming in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center NR as part of the Simula I 19611965 and Simula 67 19651968 simulation programming languages . Dahl and Nygaard were the first to develop the concepts of class , subclass allowing implicit information hiding , inheritance , dynamic object creation , etc., all important aspects of the OO paradigm. An object is a self-contained component with a data structure and associated procedures or methods  in a software system. These are combined to form a complete system. The object-oriented approach is now pervasive in modern software development , including widely used imperative programming languages such as Java and C . He received the Turing Award for his work in 2001 with Kristen Nygaard . He received the 2002 IEEE John von Neumann Medal with Kristen Nygaard 5  and was named Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 2000. 6  Early papers  edit  Multiple index countings on the Ferranti Mercury computer  by O.-J.
