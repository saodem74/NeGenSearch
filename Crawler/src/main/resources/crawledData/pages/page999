On the right is the compound isobutane , which has chemical formula CH 3  3 CH. In science , a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically, as in a mathematical formula or a chemical formula . The informal use of the term formula in science refers to the general construct of a relationship between given quantities . The plural of formula can be spelled either as formulas from the most common English plural noun form  or, under the influence of scientific Latin , formulae from the original Latin . 1  In mathematics , a formula is an entity constructed using the symbols and formation rules of a given logical language . 2  For example, determining the volume of a sphere requires a significant amount of integral calculus or its geometrical analogue, the method of exhaustion  3  but, having done this once in terms of some parameter the radius for example, mathematicians have produced a formula to describe the volume V  4 3  r 3 displaystyle Vfrac 43pi r3 . Having obtained this result, the volume of any sphere can be computed as long as its radius is known. Note that the volume V and the radius r are expressed as single letters instead of words or phrases. This convention, while less important in a relatively simple formula, means that mathematicians can more quickly manipulate larger and more complex formulas. 4  Mathematical formulas 5  are often algebraic , closed form , andor analytical . In modern chemistry , a chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound , using a single line of chemical element symbols , numbers, and sometimes other symbols, such as parentheses, brackets, and plus  and minus  signs. 6  For example, H 2 O is the chemical formula for water , specifying that each molecule consists of two hydrogen H atoms and one oxygen O atom. Similarly, O  3 denotes an ozone molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms and having a net negative charge . In a general context, formulas are applied to provide a mathematical solution for real world problems. Some may be general for example, F  m a This is one expression of Newtons second law , is applicable to a wide range of physical situations. Other formulas may be created to solve a particular problem for example, using the equation of a sine curve to model the movement of the tides in a bay . In all cases, however, formulas form the basis for calculations. Expressions are distinct from formulas in that they cannot contain an equals sign . 7  When comparing formulas to grammatical sentences , expressions are more like phrases .

There are three common non-pictorial types of chemical formulas for this molecule the empirical formula C 2 H 5 the molecular formula C 4 H 10 and the condensed formula or semi-structural formula  CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 . A chemical formula identifies each constituent element by its chemical symbol and indicates the proportionate number of atoms of each element. In empirical formulas , these proportions begin with a key element and then assign numbers of atoms of the other elements in the compound, as ratios to the key element. For molecular compounds, these ratio numbers can all be expressed as whole numbers. For example, the empirical formula of ethanol may be written C 2 H 6 O because the molecules of ethanol all contain two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. Some types of ionic compounds, however, cannot be written with entirely whole-number empirical formulas. An example is boron carbide , whose formula of CB n is a variable non-whole number ratio with n ranging from over 4 to more than 6.5. When the chemical compound of the formula consists of simple molecules , chemical formulas often employ ways to suggest the structure of the molecule. There are several types of these formulas, including molecular formulas and condensed formulas . A molecular formula enumerates the number of atoms to reflect those in the molecule, so that the molecular formula for glucose is C 6 H 12 O 6 rather than the glucose empirical formula, which is CH 2 O. Except for very simple substances, molecular chemical formulas lack needed structural information, and are ambiguous. A structural formula is a drawing that shows the location of each atom, and which atoms it binds to. In computing  edit  In computing , a formula typically describes a calculation , such as addition, to be performed on one or more variables. A formula is often implicitly provided in the form of a computer instruction such as. Degrees Celsius  59 Degrees Fahrenheit   - 32 In computer spreadsheet software, a formula indicating how to compute the value of a cell , say A3 , would be written as A1A2 where A1 and A2 refer to other cells column A, row 1 or 2 within the spreadsheet. This is a shortcut for the paper form A3  A1A2 where A3 is, by convention, omitted because the result is always stored in the cell itself and stating its name would be redundant. Formulas with prescribed units  edit  This section may be confusing or unclear to readers . Please help us clarify the section . There might be a discussion about this on the talk page .  March 2017   Learn how and when to remove this template message  A physical quantity can be expressed as the product of a number and a physical unit . A formula expresses a relationship between physical quantities. A necessary condition for a formula to be valid is that all terms have the same dimension , meaning every term in the formula could be potentially converted to contain the identical unit or product of identical units. 8  In the example of the volume of a sphere  V  4  3  r 3  we may wish to compute with r  2.0  cm, which yields V  4 3   2.0  cm  3  33.51  cm 3 . displaystyle Vfrac 43pi 2.0mbox cm3approx 33.51mbox cm3. 9  There is vast educational training about retaining units in computations, and converting units to a desirable form, such as in units conversion by factor-label . The vast majority of computations with measurements are done in computer programs with no facility for retaining a symbolic computation of the units. Only the numerical quantity is used in the computation. This requires that the universal formula be converted to a formula that is intended to be used only with prescribed units, meaning the numerical quantity is implicitly assu med to be multiplying a particular unit. The requirements about the prescribed units must be given to users of the input and the output of the formula. For example, suppose the formula is to require that V  V O L   t b s p displaystyle Vequiv mathrm VOL mathbf tbsp  , where tbsp is the US tablespoon and VOL is the name for the number used by the computer. Similarly, the formula is to require r  R A D   c m displaystyle requiv mathrm RAD mathbf cm  . The derivation of the formula proceeds as V O L   t b s p  4 3  R A D 3   c m 3 . displaystyle mathrm VOL mathbf tbsp frac 43pi mathrm RAD 3mathbf cm 3. Given that 1   t b s p  14.787   c m 3 displaystyle 1mathbf tbsp 14.787mathbf cm 3 , the formula with prescribed units is V O L  0.2833   R A D 3 . displaystyle mathrm VOL approx 0.2833mathrm RAD 3. 10  The formula is not complete without words such as VOL is volume in tbsp and RAD is radius in cm . Other possible words are VOL is the ratio of V displaystyle V to tbsp and RAD is the ratio of r displaystyle r to cm . The formula with prescribed units could also appear with simple symbols, perhaps even the identical symbols as in the original dimensional formula V  0.2833   r 3 . displaystyle V0.2833r3. and the accompanying words could be where V is volume  tbsp  and r is radius  cm . If the physical formula is not dimensionally homogeneous, and therefore erroneous, the falsehood becomes apparent in the impossibility to derive a formula with prescribed units. It would not be possible to derive a formula consisting only of numbers and dimensionless ratios. In science  edit  Formulas used in science almost always require a choice of units. 11  Formulas are used to express relationships between various quantities, such as temperature, mass, or charge in physics supply, profit, or demand in economics or a wide range of other quantities in other disciplines. An example of a formula used in science is Boltzmanns entropy formula . In statistical thermodynamics , it is a probability equation relating the entropy S of an ideal gas to the quantity W , which is the number of microstates corresponding to a given macrostate  S  k  log  W displaystyle Skcdot log W           1 S k ln W where k is Boltzmanns constant equal to 1.38062 x 10 23 joulekelvin and W is the number of microstates consistent with the given macrostate .
