David Parnas From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search David Parnas Born  1941-02-10  February 10, 1941 age  78 Plattsburgh, New York , United States Known  for Information hiding , Strategic Defense Initiative activism Scientific career Doctoral advisor Alan Perlis Everard Mott Williams Doctoral students Richard J. Lipton Steven M. Bellovin David Lorge Parnas born February 10, 1941 is a Canadian early pioneer of software engineering , who developed the concept of information hiding in modular programming , which is an important element of object-oriented programming today. He is also noted for his advocacy of precise documentation.

Parnas also earned a professional engineering license in Canada and was one of the first to apply traditional engineering principles to software design. He worked there as a professor for many years. He also taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill U.S., the Technische Universitt Darmstadt Germany, the University of Victoria  British Columbia , Canada, Queens University in Kingston, Ontario , McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario , and University of Limerick Republic of Ireland. David Parnas received a number of awards and honors ACM Best Paper Award, 1979 Norbert Wiener Award for Social and Professional Responsibility , 1987 Two Most Influential Paper awards International Conference on Software Engineering , 1991 and 1995 Doctor honoris causa of the Computer Science Department, ETH Zurich , Switzerland, 1986 Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada , 1992 1  Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery , 1994 Doctor honoris causa of the Louvain School of Engineering , University of Louvain UCLouvain, Belgium, 1996 ACM SIGSOFT s Outstanding Research award, 1998 IEEE Computer Society s 60th Anniversary Award, 2007 Doctor honoris causa of the Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano , Switzerland, 2008 Fellow of the Gesellschaft fr Informatik , 2008 2  Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE , 2009 Doctor honoris causa of the Vienna University of Technology Dr. Tech.H.C., Vienna Austria, 2011 Work  edit  Modular design  edit  In modular design , his double dictum  citation needed  of high cohesion within modules and loose coupling between modules is fundamental to modular design in software. However, in Parnass seminal 1972 paper On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules , this dictum is expressed in terms of information hiding , and the terms cohesion and coupling are not used. He never used them. 3  Technical activism  edit  Dr Parnas took a public stand against the US Strategic Defense Initiative also known as Star Wars in the mid 1980s, arguing that it would be impossible to write an application of sufficient quality that it could be trusted to prevent a nuclear attack. 4  He has also been in the forefront of those urging the professionalization of  software engineering  a term that he characterizes as an unconsummated marriage. Dr. Parnas is also a heavy promoter of ethics in the field of software engineering. Stance on academic evaluation methods  edit  Parnas has joined the group of scientists which openly criticize the number-of-publications-based approach towards ranking academic production. On his November 2007 paper Stop the Numbers Game , 5  he elaborates on several reasons on why the current number-based academic evaluation system used in many fields by universities all over the world be it either oriented to the amount of publications or the amount of quotations each of those get is flawed and, instead of generating more advance of the sciences, it leads to knowledge stagnation.
