It extends normal logic programming by allowing some predicates to be incompletely defined, declared as abducible predicates. Abductive reasoning  also called abduction, 1  abductive inference, 1  or retroduction 2   is a form of logical inference which starts with an observation or set of observations then seeks to find the simplest and most likely explanation. This process, unlike deductive reasoning , yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it. Abstract data type  is a mathematical model for data types , where a data type is defined by its behavior  semantics  from the point of view of a user of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations. Abstraction  is the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details 3  or attributes in the study of objects or systems in order to more closely attend to other details of interest 4  Accelerating change  is a perceived increase in the rate of technological change throughout history, which may suggest faster and more profound change in the future and may or may not be accompanied by equally profound social and cultural change. Action language  is a language for specifying state transition systems , and is commonly used to create formal models of the effects of actions on the world. 5  Action languages are commonly used in the artificial intelligence and robotics domains, where they describe how actions affect the states of systems over time, and may be used for automated planning . Action model learning  is an area of machine learning concerned with creation and modification of software agents knowledge about effects and preconditions of the actions that can be executed within its environment. This knowledge is usually represented in logic-based action description language and used as the input for automated planners. Action selection  is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems what to do next. In artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science, the action selection problem is typically associated with intelligent agents and animatsartificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an agent environment.

Adaptive algorithm  an algorithm that changes its behavior at the time it is run, based on a priori defined reward mechanism or criterion. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system  or adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system ANFIS is a kind of artificial neural network that is based on TakagiSugeno fuzzy inference system . The technique was developed in the early 1990s. 6  7  Since it integrates both neural networks and fuzzy logic principles, it has potential to capture the benefits of both in a single framework . Its inference system corresponds to a set of fuzzy IFTHEN rules that have learning capability to approximate nonlinear functions. 8  Hence, ANFIS is considered to be a universal estimator. 9  For using the ANFIS in a more efficient and optimal way, one can use the best parameters obtained by genetic algorithm. 10  11  Admissible heuristic  In computer science , specifically in algorithms related to pathfinding , a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path. 12  Affective computing  sometimes called artificial emotional intelligence, or emotion AI 13  is the study and development of systems and devices that can recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects .

AI-complete  In the field of artificial intelligence, the most difficult problems are informally known as AI-complete or AI-hard, implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problemmaking computers as intelligent as people, or strong AI . 18  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm. Algorithm  is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks. Algorithmic efficiency  is a property of an algorithm which relates to the number of computational resources used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analyzed to determine its resource usage, and the efficiency of an algorithm can be measured based on usage of different resources. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeating or continuous process. Algorithmic probability  In algorithmic information theory , algorithmic probability, also known as Solomonoff probability, is a mathematical method of assigning a prior probability to a given observation. It was invented by Ray Solomonoff in the 1960s. 19  AlphaGo  is a computer program that plays the board game Go . 20  It was developed by Alphabet Inc. s Google DeepMind in London.

An API may be for a web-based system, operating system , database system , computer hardware, or software library . Approximate string matching  often colloquially referred to as fuzzy string searching is the technique of finding strings that match a pattern approximately rather than exactly. The problem of approximate string matching is typically divided into two sub-problems finding approximate substring matches inside a given string and finding dictionary strings that match the pattern approximately. Approximation error  The approximation error in some data is the discrepancy between an exact value and some approximation to it. Argumentation framework  or argumentation system, is a way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it. In an abstract argumentation framework, 24  entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. Conflicts between arguments are represented by a binary relation on the set of arguments. In concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a directed graph such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation. There exist some extensions of the Dungs framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworks 25  or the value-based argumentation frameworks. 26  Artificial immune system  Artificial immune systems AIS are a class of computationally intelligent, rule-based machine learning systems inspired by the principles and processes of the vertebrate immune system .

In this model, a text such as a sentence or a document is represented as the bag multiset of its words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity . The bag-of-words model has also been used for computer vision . 45  The bag-of-words model is commonly used in methods of document classification where the frequency of occurrence of each word is used as a feature for training a classifier . 46  Bag-of-words model in computer vision  In computer vision, the bag-of-words model BoW model can be applied to image classification , by treating image features as words. In document classification, a bag of words is a sparse vector of occurrence counts of words that is, a sparse histogram over the vocabulary.

The effectiveness and specific abilities of the bees algorithm have been proven in a number of studies. 52  53  54  55  Behavior informatics  BI is the informatics of behaviors so as to obtain behavior intelligence and behavior insights. 56  Behavior tree  A Behavior Tree BT is a mathematical model of plan execution used in computer science , robotics , control systems and video games . They describe switchings between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion. Their strength comes from their ability to create very complex tasks composed of simple tasks, without worrying how the simple tasks are implemented. BTs present some similarities to hierarchical state machines with the key difference that the main building block of a behavior is a task rather than a state. Its ease of human understanding make BTs less error-prone and very popular in the game developer community. BTs have shown to generalize several other control architectures. 57  58  Belief-desire-intention software model  BDI, is a software model developed for programming intelligent agents . Superficially characterized by the implementation of an agents beliefs , desires and intentions , it actually uses these concepts to solve a particular problem in agent programming. In essence, it provides a mechanism for separating the activity of selecting a plan from a plan library or an external planner application from the execution of currently active plans. Consequently, BDI agents are able to balance the time spent on deliberating about plans choosing what to d o and executing those plans doing it. A third activity, creating the plans in the first place planning, is not within the scope of the model, and is left to the system designer and programmer. Biasvariance tradeoff  In statistics and machine learning , the biasvariance tradeoff is the property of a set of predictive models whereby models with a lower bias in parameter estimation have a higher variance of the parameter estimates across samples , and vice versa. Big data  is a term used to refer to data sets that are too large or complex for traditional data-processing application software to adequately deal with. Data with many cases rows offer greater statistical power , while data with higher complexity more attributes or columns may lead to a higher false discovery rate . 59  Big O notation  is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann , 60  Edmund Landau , 61  and others, collectively called BachmannLandau notation or asymptotic notation. Binary tree  is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children , which are referred to as the left child and the right child . A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a non-empty binary tree is a tuple  L , S , R , where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set . 62  Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well. 63  Blackboard system  is an artificial intelligence approach based on the blackboard architectural model , 64  65  66  67  where a common knowledge base, the blackboard, is iteratively updated by a diverse group of specialist knowledge sources, starting with a problem specification and ending with a solution. Each knowledge source updates the blackboard with a partial solution when its internal constraints match the blackboard state. In this way, the specialists work together to solve the prob lem. Boltzmann machine  also called stochastic Hopfield network with hidden units is a type of stochastic recurrent neural network and Markov random field . 68  Boltzmann machines can be seen as the stochastic , generative counterpart of Hopfield networks . Boolean satisfiability problem  sometimes called propositional satisfiability problem and abbreviated SATISFIABILITY or SAT is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula . In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE . If this is the case, the formula is called satisfiable . On the other hand, if no such assignment exists, the function expressed by the formula is FALSE for all possible variable assignments and the formula is unsatisfiable . For example, the formula  a AND NOT b  is satisfiable because one can find the values a    TRUE and b    FALSE, which make  a AND NOT b     TRUE. In contrast,  a AND NOT a  is unsatisfiable. Brain technology  or self-learning know-how systems, defines a technology that employs latest findings in neuroscience . The term was first introduced by the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland , in the context of the ROBOY project. 69  Brain Technology can be employed in robots, 70  know-how management systems 71  and any other application with self-learning capabilities. In particular, Brain Technology applications allow the visualization of the underlying learning architecture often coined as know-how maps. Branching factor  In computing , tree data structures , and game theory , the branching factor is the number of children at each node , the outdegree . If this value is not uniform, an average branching factor can be calculated.

In this clause, X  Y  0 is a constraint AX,Y , BX , and CY are literals as in regular logic programming. This clause states one condition under which the statement AX,Y holds XY is greater than zero and both BX and CY are true. Constraint programming  is a programming paradigm wherein relations between variables are stated in the form of constraints .

Data fusion  is the process of integrating multiple data sources to produce more consistent, accurate, and useful information than that provided by any individual data source. 132  Data integration  involves combining data residing in different sources and providing users with a unified view of them. 133  This process becomes significant in a variety of situations, which include both commercial such as when two similar companies need to merge their databases  and scientific combining research results from different bioinformatics repositories, for example domains. Data integration appears with increasing frequency as the volume that is, big data 134   and the need to share existing data explodes . 135  It has become the focus of extensive theoretical work, and numerous open problems remain unsolved. Data mining  is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. Data science  is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured, 136  137  similar to data mining . Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. 138  It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics , statistics , information science , and computer science . Data set  or dataset is a collection of data . Most commonly a data set corresponds to the contents of a single database table , or a single statistical data matrix , where every column of the table represents a particular variable, and each row corresponds to a given member of the data set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set. Each value is known as a datum. The data set may comprise data for one or more members, corresponding to the number of rows. Data warehouse  DW or DWH, also known as an enterprise data warehouse EDW, is a system used for reporting and data analysis . 139  DWs are central repositories of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.

In recent years, Datalog has found new application in data integration , information extraction , networking , program analysis , security , and cloud computing . 141  Decision boundary  In the case of backpropagation based artificial neural networks or perceptrons , the type of decision boundary that the network can learn is determined by the number of hidden layers the network has. If it has no hidden layers, then it can only learn linear problems. If it has one hidden layer, then it can learn any continuous function on compact subsets of R n as shown by the Universal approximation theorem , thus it can have an arbitrary decision boundary. Decision support system  DSS, is an information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization usually mid and higher management and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advancei.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combi nation of both. Decision theory  or the theory of choice is the study of the reasoning underlying an agents choices. 142  Decision theory can be broken into two branches normative decision theory, which gives advice on how to make the best decisions given a set of uncertain beliefs and a set of values , and descriptive decision theory which analyzes how existing, possibly irrational agents actually make decisions. Decision tree learning  uses a decision tree as a predictive model  to go from observations about an item represented in the branches to conclusions about the items target value represented in the leaves. It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics , data mining and machine learning . Declarative programming  is a programming paradigm a style of building the structure and elements of computer programsthat expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow . 143  Deductive classifier  is a type of artificial intelligence inference engine . It takes as input a set of declarations in a frame language about a domain such as medical research or molecular biology. For example, the names of classes, sub-classes , properties, and restrictions on allowable values. Deep Blue  was a chess-playing computer developed by IBM . It is known for being the first computer chess-playing system to win both a chess game and a chess match against a reigning world champion under regular time controls. Deep learning  also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations , as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised , semi-supervised or unsupervised . 144  145  146  DeepMind  DeepMind Technologies is a British artificial intelligence company founded in September 2010, currently owned by Alphabet Inc. The company is based in London , with research centres in Canada , 147  France , 148  and the United States . Acquired by Google in 2014, the company has created a neural network that learns how to play video games in a fashion similar to that of humans, 149  as well as a Neural Turing machine , 150  or a neural network that may be able to access an external memory like a conventional Turing machine , resulting in a computer that mimics the short-term memory of the human brain. 151  152  The company made headlines in 2016 after its AlphaGo program beat a human professional Go player Lee Sedol , the world champion, in a five-game match , which was the subject of a documentary film. 153  A more general program, AlphaZero , beat the most powerful programs playing go , chess and shogi Japanese chess after a few days of play against itself using reinforcement learning . 154  Default logic  is a non-monotonic logic proposed by Raymond Reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions. Description logic  Description logics DL are a family of formal knowledge representation languages. Many DLs are more expressive than propositional logic but less expressive than first-order logic . In contrast to the latter, the core reasoning problems for DLs are usually decidable , and efficient decision procedures have been designed and implemented for these problems. There are general, spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal, and fuzzy descriptions logics, and each description logic features a different balance between DL expressivity and reasoning complexity by supporting different sets of mathematical constructors. 155  Developmental robotics  DevRob, sometimes called epigenetic robotics, is a scientific field which aims at studying the developmental mechanisms, architectures and constraints that allow lifelong and open-ended learning of new skills and new knowledge in embodied machines . Diagnosis  is concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behaviour of a system is correct. If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine, as accurately as possible, which part of the system is failing, and which kind of fault it is facing. The computation is based on observations , which provide information on the current behaviour. Dialogue system  or conversational agent CA, is a computer system intended to converse with a human with a coherent structure. Dialogue systems have employed text, speech, graphics, haptics, gestures, and other modes for communication on both the input and output channel. Dimensionality reduction  or dimension reduction, is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration 156  by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be divided into feature selection and feature extraction . 157  Discrete system  is a system with a countable number of states. Discrete systems may be contrasted with continuous systems, which may also be called analog systems. A final discrete system is often modeled with a directed graph and is analyzed for correctness and complexity according to computational theory . Because discrete systems have a countable number of states, they may be described in precise mathematical models . A computer is a finite state machine that may be viewed as a discrete system. Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a continuous signal at discrete time intervals.

The connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can reproduce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons. Thus, the error function is quadra tic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system. Embodied agent  also sometimes referred to as an interface agent, 166  is an intelligent agent that interacts with the environment through a physical body within that environment. Agents that are represented graphically with a body, for example a human or a cartoon animal, are also called embodied agents, although they have only virtual, not physical, embodiment. Embodied cognitive science  is an interdisciplinary field of research, the aim of which is to explain the mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior. It comprises three main methodologies 1 the modeling of psychological and biological systems in a holistic manner that considers the mind and body as a single entity, 2 the formation of a common set of general principles of intelligent behavior, and 3 the experimental use of robotic agents in controlled environments. Error-driven learning  is a sub-area of machine learning concerned with how an agent ought to take actions in an environment so as to minimize some error feedback. It is a type of reinforcement learning . Ensemble averaging  In machine learning , particularly in the creation of artificial neural networks , ensemble averaging is the process of creating multiple models and combining them to produce a desired output, as opposed to creating just one model. Ethics of artificial intelligence  is the part of the ethics of technology specific to artificial intelligence. Evolutionary algorithm  EA, is a subset of evolutionary computation , 167  a generic population-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm . An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution , such as reproduction , mutation , recombination , and selection . Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions see also loss function . Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators. Evolutionary computation  is a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution , and the subfield of artificial intelligence and soft computing studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character. Evolving classification function  ECF, evolving classifier functions or evolving classifiers are used for classifying and clustering in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence , typically employed for data stream mining tasks in dynamic and changing environments.

Fast-and-frugal trees can be used as decision-making tools which operate as lexicographic classifiers, and, if required, associate an action decision to each class or category. 173  Feature extraction  In machine learning , pattern recognition and in image processing , feature extraction starts from an initial set of measured data and builds derived values  features  intended to be informative and non-redundant, facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps, and in some cases leading to better human interpretations. Feature learning  In machine learning , feature learning or representation learning 174  is a set of techniques that allows a system to automatically discover the representations needed for feature detection or classification from raw data. This replaces manual feature engineering and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature selection  In machine learning and statistics , feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features variables, predictors for use in model construction. Federated learning  a type of machine learning that allows for training on multiple devices with decentralized data, thus helping preserve the privacy of individual users and their data. First-order logic also known as first-order predicate calculus and predicate logic  a collection of formal systems used in mathematics , philosophy , linguistics , and computer science . First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man and there exists is a quantifier while X is a variable. 175  This distinguishes it from propositional logic , which does not use quantifiers or relations. 176  Fluent   a condition that can change over time. In logical approaches to reasoning about actions, fluents can be represented in first-order logic by predicates having an argument that depends on time. Formal language  a set of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules. Forward chaining  or forward reasoning is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an inference engine and can be described logically as repeated application of modus ponens . Forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for expert systems , business and production rule systems . The opposite of forward chaining is backward chaining . Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data from an end user, for example until a goal is reached. An inference engine using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the antecedent If clause is known to be true. When such a rule is found, the engine can conclude, or infer, the consequent Then clause, resulting in the addition of new information to its data. 177  Frame   an artificial intelligence data structure used to divide knowledge into substructures by representing  stereotyped situations. Frames are the primary data structure used in artificial intelligence frame language . Frame language  a technology used for knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Frames are stored as ontologies of sets and subsets of the frame concepts . They are similar to class hierarchies in object-oriented languages although their fundamental design goals are different. Frames are focused on explicit and intuitive representation of knowledge whereas objects focus on encapsulation and information hiding . Frames originated in AI research and objects primarily in software engineering . However, in practice the techniques and capabilities of frame and object-oriented languages overlap significantly. Frame problem  is the problem of finding adequate collections of axioms for a viable description of a robot environment. 178  Friendly artificial intelligence also friendly AI or FAI  a hypothetical artificial general intelligence AGI that would have a positive effect on humanity. It is a part of the ethics of artificial intelligence and is closely related to machine ethics . While machine ethics is concerned with how an artificially intelligent agent should behave, friendly artificial intelligence research is focused on how to practically bring about this behaviour and ensuring it is adequately constrained. Futures studies  is the study of postulating possible, probable, and preferable futures and the worldviews and myths that underlie them. 179  Fuzzy control system   a control system based on fuzzy logic a mathematical system that analyzes analog input values in terms of logical variables that take on continuous values between 0 and 1, in contrast to classical or digital logic, which operates on discrete values of either 1 or 0 true or false, respectively. 180  181  Fuzzy logic   a simple form for the many-valued logic , in which the truth values of variables may have any degree of  Truthfulness  that can be represented by any real number in the range between 0 as in Completely False and 1 as in Completely True inclusive. Consequently, It is employed to handle the concept of partial truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. In contrast to Boolean logic , where the truth values of variables may have the integer values 0 or 1 only. Fuzzy rule  Fuzzy rules are used within fuzzy logic systems to infer an output based on input variables. Fuzzy set  In classical set theory , the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a bivalent condition  an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set this is described with the aid of a membership function valued in the real unit interval 0,  1. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the indicator functions aka characteristic functions of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1. 182  In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called crisp sets . The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as bioinformatics . 183  Contents    Top 09 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z See also References External links G  edit  Game theory  is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction between rational decision-makers. 184  Generative adversarial network  GAN, is a class of machine learning systems.

Graph abstract data type  In computer science , a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from mathematics  specifically, the field of graph theory . Graph discrete mathematics  In mathematics , and more specifically in graph theory , a graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense related. The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices also called nodes or points  and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge also called an arc or line . 186  Graph database  GDB 187  , is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes , edges and properties to represent and store data. A key concept of the system is the graph or edge or relationship , which directly relates data items in the store a collection of nodes of data and edges representing the relationships between the nodes. The relationships allow data in the store to be linked together directly, and in many cases retrieved with one operation. Graph databases hold the relationships between data as a priority. Querying relationships within a graph database is f ast because they are perpetually stored within the database itself. Relationships can be intuitively visualized using graph databases, making it useful for heavily inter-connected data. 188  Graph theory  is the study of graphs , which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Graph traversal  also known as graph search refers to the process of visiting checking andor updating each vertex in a graph . Such traversals are classified by the order in which the vertices are visited. Tree traversal is a special case of graph traversal. H  edit  Heuristic  is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy , or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. A heuristic function, also called simply a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution. 189  Hidden layer  an internal layer of neurons in an artificial neural network , not dedicated to input or output Hidden unit  an neuron in a hidden layer in an artificial neural network Hyper-heuristic  is a heuristic search method that seeks to automate, often by the incorporation of machine learning techniques, the process of selecting, combining, generating or adapting several simpler heuristics or components of such heuristics to efficiently solve computational search problems. One of the motivations for studying hyper-heuristics is to build systems which can handle classes of problems rather than solving just one problem. 190  191  192  I  edit  IEEE Computational Intelligence Society  is a professional society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE focussing on the theory, design, application, and development of biologically and linguistically motivated computational paradigms emphasizing neural networks , connectionist systems, genetic algorithms , evolutionary programming , fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems in which these paradigms are contained. 193  Incremental learning  is a method of machine learning , in which input data is continuously used to extend the existing models knowledge i.e. to further train the model. It represents a dynamic technique of supervised learning and unsupervised learning that can be applied when training data becomes available gradually over time or its size is out of system memory limits. Algorithms that can facilitate incremental learning are known as incremental machine learning algorithms. Inference engine  is a component of the system that applies logical rules to the knowledge base to deduce new information. Information integration  II, is the merging of information from heterogeneous sources with differing conceptual, contextual and typographical representations. It is used in data mining and consolidation of data from unstructured or semi-structured resources. Typically, information integration refers to textual representations of knowledge but is sometimes applied to rich-media content.

Intelligent agent  IA, is an autonomous entity which acts, directing its activity towards achieving goals i.e. it is an agent , upon an environment using observation through sensors and consequent actuators i.e. it is intelligent. Intelligent agents may also learn or use knowledge to achieve their goals. They may be very simple or very complex . Intelligent control  is a class of control techniques that use various artificial intelligence computing approaches like neural networks , Bayesian probability , fuzzy logic , machine learning , reinforcement learning , evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms . 194  Intelligent personal assistant  A virtual assistant or intelligent personal assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on verbal commands.

Some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars with verbal command s. 195  Interpretation logic  is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a formal language . Many formal languages used in mathematics , logic , and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called formal semantics . Issue tree  Also called logic tree, is a graphical breakdown of a question that dissects it into its different components vertically and that progresses into details as it reads to the right. 196   47 Issue trees are useful in problem solving to identify the root causes of a problem as well as to identify its potential solutions.

KL-ONE  is a well known knowledge representation system in the tradition of semantic networks and frames  that is, it is a frame language . The system is an attempt to overcome semantic indistinctness in semantic network representations and to explicitly represent conceptual information as a structured inheritance network. 199  200  201  Knowledge acquisition  is the process used to define the rules and ontologies required for a knowledge-based system . The phrase was first used in conjunction with expert systems to describe the initial tasks associated with developing an expert system, namely finding and interviewing domain experts and capturing their knowledge via rules , objects , and frame-based ontologies . Knowledge-based systems  A knowledge-based system KBS is a computer program that reasons and uses a knowledge base to solve complex problems . The term is broad and refers to many different kinds of systems. The one common theme that unites all knowledge based systems is an attempt to represent knowledge explicitly and a reasoning system that allows it to derive new knowledge. Thus, a knowledge-based system has two distinguishing features a knowledge base and an inference engine . Knowledge engineering  KE refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems . Knowledge extraction  is the creation of knowledge from structured  relational databases , XML  and unstructured  text , documents, images  sources. The resulting knowledge needs to be in a machine-readable and machine-interpretable format and must represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates inferencing. Although it is methodically similar to information extraction  NLP  and ETL data warehouse, the main criteria is that the extraction result goes beyond the creation of structured information or the transformation into a relational schema . It requires either the reuse of existing formal knowledge reusing identifiers or ontologies  or the generation of a schema based on the source data. Knowledge Interchange Format  KIF is a computer language designed to enable systems to share and re-use information from knowledge-based systems . KIF is similar to frame languages such as KL-ONE and LOOM but unlike such language its primary role is not intended as a framework for the expression or use of knowledge but rather for the interchange of knowledge between systems. The designers of KIF likened it to PostScript . PostScript was not designed primarily as a language to store and manipulate documents but rather as an interchange format for systems and devices to share documents. In the same way KIF is meant to facilitate sharing of knowledge across different systems that use different languages, formalisms, platforms, etc. Knowledge representation and reasoning  KR, KR R is the field of artificial intelligence AI dedicated to representing information about the world in a form that a computer system can utilize to solve complex tasks such as diagnosing a medical condition or having a dialog in a natural language . Knowledge representation incorporates findings from psychology 202  about how humans solve problems and represent knowledge in order to design formalisms that will make complex systems easier to design and build.

Examples of automated reasoning engines include inference engines , theorem provers , and classifiers. L  edit  Lazy learning  In machine learning , lazy learning is a learning method in which generalization of the training data is, in theory, delayed until a query is made to the system, as opposed to in eager learning , where the system tries to generalize the training data before receiving queries.

Machine vision is a term encompassing a large number of technologies, software and hardware products, integrated systems, actions, methods and expertise. Machine vision as a systems engineering discipline can be considered distinct from computer vision , a form of computer science . It attempts to integrate existing technologies in new ways and apply them to solve real world problems. The term is the prevalent one for these functions in industrial automation environments but is also used for these functions in other environments such as security and vehicle guidance. Markov chain  is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. 207  208  209  Markov decision process  MDP is a discrete time stochastic control process.

Mechatronics  which is also called mechatronic engineering, is a multidisciplinary branch of engineering that focuses on the engineering of both electrical and mechanical systems , and also includes a combination of robotics , electronics , computer , telecommunications , systems , control , and product engineering. 216  217  Metabolic network reconstruction and simulation  allows for an in-depth insight into the molecular mechanisms of a particular organism. In particular, these models correlate the genome with molecular physiology . 218  Metaheuristic  In computer science and mathematical optimization , a metaheuristic is a higher-level procedure or heuristic designed to find, generate, or select a heuristic partial search algorithm  that may provide a sufficiently good solution to an optimization problem , especially with incomplete or imperfect information or limited computation capacity. 219  220  Metaheuristics sample a set of solutions which is too large to be completely sampled. Model checking  In computer science , model checking or property checking is, for a given model of a system, exhaustively and automatically checking whether this model meets a given specification . Typically, one has hardware or software systems in mind, whereas the specification contains safety requirements such as the absence of deadlocks and similar critical states that can cause the system to crash . Model checking is a technique for automatically verifying correctness properties of finite-state systems. Modus ponens  In propositional logic , modus ponens is a rule of inference . 221  It can be summarized as  P implies Q and P is asserted to be true, therefore Q must be true. Modus tollens  In propositional logic , modus tollens is a valid argument form and a rule of inference . It is an application of the general truth that if a statement is true, then so is its contrapositive . The inference rule modus tollens asserts that the inference from P implies Q to the negation of Q implies the negation of P is valid.

Multi-agent systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include methodic , functional , procedural approaches, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning . Multi-swarm optimization  is a variant of particle swarm optimization PSO based on the use of multiple sub-swarms instead of one standard swarm. The general approach in multi-swarm optimization is that each sub-swarm focuses on a specific region while a specific diversification method decides where and when to launch the sub-swarms. The multi-swarm framework is especially fitted for the optimization on multi-modal problems, where multiple l ocal optima exist. Mutation  is a genetic operator used to maintain genetic diversity from one generation of a population of genetic algorithm chromosomes to the next. It is analogous to biological mutation . Mutation alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state. In mutation, the solution may change entirely from the previous solution. Hence GA can come to a better solution by using mutation. Mutation occurs during evolution according to a user-definable mutation probability. This probability should be set low. If it is set too high, the search will turn i nto a primitive random search. Mycin  was an early backward chaining expert system that used artificial intelligence to identify bacteria causing severe infections, such as bacteremia and meningitis , and to recommend antibiotics , with the dosage adjusted for patients body weight  the name derived from the antibiotics themselves, as many antibiotics have the suffix -mycin. The MYCIN system was also used for the diagnosis of blood clotting diseases.

Naive semantics  is an approach used in computer science for representing basic knowledge about a specific domain, and has been used in applications such as the representation of the meaning of natural language sentences in artificial intelligence applications. In a general setting the term has been used to refer to the use of a limited store of generally understood knowledge about a specific domain in the world, and has been applied to fields such as the knowledge based design of data schemas. 222  Name binding  In programming languages, name binding is the association of entities data andor code with identifiers . 223  An identifier bound to an object is said to reference that object. Machine languages have no built-in notion of identifiers, but name-object bindings as a service and notation for the programmer is implemented by programming languages. Binding is intimately connected with scoping , as scope determines which names bind to which objects  at which locations in the program code  lexically  and in which one of the possible execution paths  temporally . Use of an identifier id in a context that establishes a binding for id is called a binding or defining occurrence. In all other occurrences e.g., in expressions, assignments, and subprogram calls, an identifier stands for what it is bound to such occurrences are called applied occurrences. Named-entity recognition  NER, also known as entity identification, entity chunking and entity extraction is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes , time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. Named graph  Named graphs are a key concept of Semantic Web architecture in which a set of Resource Description Framework statements a graph  are identified using a URI , 224  allowing descriptions to be made of that set of statements such as context, provenance information or other such metadata . Named graphs are a simple extension of the RDF data model 225  through which graphs can be created but the model lacks an effective means of distinguishing between them once published on the Web at large. Natural language generation  NLG, is a software process that transforms structured data into plain-English content. It can be used to produce long-form content for organizations to automate custom reports, as well as produce custom content for a web or mobile application. It can also be used to generate short blurbs of text in interactive conversations a chatbot  which might even be read out loud by a text-to-speech system. Natural language processing  NLP, is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human natural languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Natural language programming  is an ontology -assisted way of programming in terms of natural-language sentences, e.g. English . 226  Network motif  All networks, including biological networks, social networks, technological networks e.g., computer networks and electrical circuits and more, can be represented as graphs , which include a wide variety of subgraphs. One important local property of networks are so-called network motifs, which are defined as recurrent and statistically significant sub-graphs or patterns. Neural machine translation  NMT, is an approach to machine translation that uses a large artificial neural network to predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, typically modeling entire sentences in a single integrated model. Neural Turing machine  NTMs is a recurrent neural network model. NTMs combine the fuzzy pattern matching capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic power of programmable computers . An NTM has a neural network controller coupled to external memory resources, which it interacts with through attentional mechanisms. The memory interactions are differentiable end-to-end, making it possible to optimize them using gradient descent . 227  An NTM with a long short-term memory LSTM network controller can infer simple algorithms such as copying, sorting, and associative recall from examples alone. 228  Neuro-fuzzy  refers to combinations of artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic . Neurocybernetics  A braincomputer interface BCI, sometimes called a neural-control interface NCI, mind-machine interface MMI, direct neural interface DNI, or brainmachine interface BMI, is a direct communication pathway between an enhanced or wired brain and an external device. BCI differs from neuromodulation in that it allows for bidirectional information flow. BCIs are often directed at researching, mapping, assisting, augmenting, or repairing human cognitive or sensory-motor functions. 229  Neuromorphic engineering  also known as neuromorphic computing, 230  231  232  is a concept describing the use of very-large-scale integration VLSI systems containing electronic analog circuits to mimic neuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system. 233  In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analogdigital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems for perception , motor control , or multisensory integration . The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors , 234  spintronic memories, 235  threshold switches, and transistors . 236  Node  is a basic unit of a data structure , such as a linked list or tree data structure. Nodes contain data and also may link to other nodes. Links between nodes are often implemented by pointers . Nondeterministic algorithm  is an algorithm that, even for the same input, can exhibit different behaviors on different runs, as opposed to a deterministic algorithm . Nouvelle AI  Nouvelle AI differs from classical AI by aiming to produce robots with intelligence levels similar to insects. Researchers believe that intelligence can emerge organically from simple behaviors as these intelligences interacted with the real world, instead of using the constructed worlds which symbolic AIs typically needed to have programmed into them. 237  NP  In computational complexity theory , NP nondeterministic polynomial time is a complexity class used to classify decision problems . NP is the set of decision problems for which the problem instances , where the answer is yes, have proofs verifiable in polynomial time . 238  Note 1  NP-completeness  In computational complexity theory , a problem is NP-complete when it can be solved by a restricted class of brute force search algorithms and it can be used to simulate any other problem with a similar algorithm. More precisely, each input to the problem should be associated with a set of solutions of polynomial length, whose validity can be tested quickly in polynomial time 239  , such that the output for any input is yes if the solution set is non-empty and no if it is empty. NP-hardness   non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness, in computational complexity theory , is the defining property of a class of problems that are, informally, at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. A simple example of an NP-hard problem is the subset sum problem . O  edit  Occams razor  also Ockhams razor or Ochams razor, is the problem-solving principle that states that when presented with competing hypotheses that make the same predictions, one should select the solution with the fewest assumptions 240  and is not meant to filter out hypotheses that make different predictions. The idea is attributed to English Franciscan friar William of Ockham  c. 12871347, a scholastic philosopher and theologian . Offline learning  Online machine learning  is a method of machine learning in which data becomes available in a sequential order and is used to update the best predictor for future data at each step, as opposed to batch learning techniques which generate the best predictor by learning on the entire training data set at once. Online learning is a common technique used in areas of machine learning where it is computationally infeasible to train over th e entire dataset, requiring the need of out-of-core algorithms. It is also used in situations where it is necessary for the algorithm to dynamically adapt to new patterns in the data, or when the data itself is generated as a function of time. Ontology learning  ontology extraction, ontology generation, or ontology acquisition, is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies , including extracting the corresponding domains terms and the relationships between the concepts that these terms represent from a corpus of natural language text, and encoding them with an ontology language for easy retrieval. OpenAI  is the for-profit corporation OpenAI LP, whose parent organization is the non-profit organization OpenAI Inc 241  that conducts research in the field of artificial intelligence AI with the stated aim to promote and develop friendly AI in such a way as to benefit humanity as a whole. OpenCog  is a project that aims to build an open source artificial intelligence framework.

Open-source software  OSS, is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. 243  Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner . Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration . 244  P  edit  Partial order reduction  is a technique for reducing the size of the state-space to be searched by a model checking or automated planning and scheduling algorithm . It exploits the commutativity of concurrently executed transitions , which result in the same state when executed in different orders. Partially observable Markov decision process  POMDP, is a generalization of a Markov decision process MDP. A POMDP models an agent decision process in which it is assumed that the system dynamics are determined by an MDP, but the agent cannot directly observe the underlying state. Instead, it must maintain a probability distribution over the set of possible states, based on a set of observations and observation probabilities, and the underlying MDP. Particle swarm optimization  PSO 245  is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles , and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particles position and velocity . Each particles movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. Pathfinding  or pathing, is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points. It is a more practical variant on solving mazes . This field of research is based heavily on Dijkstras algorithm for finding a shortest path on a weighted graph . Pattern recognition  is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories. 246  Predicate logic  First-order logicalso known as predicate logic and first-order predicate calculusis a collection of formal systems used in mathematics , philosophy , linguistics , and computer science . First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man and there exists is a quantifier while x is a variable. 175  This distinguishes it from propositional logic , which does not use quantifiers or relations  247  in this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic. Predictive analytics  encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from data mining , predictive modelling , and machine learning , that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events. 248  249  Principal component analysis  PCA, is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables entities each of which takes on various numerical values into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible, and each succeeding component, in turn, has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set . PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables. Principle of rationality  or rationality principle, was coined by Karl R. Popper in his Harvard Lecture of 1963, and published in his book Myth of Framework . 250  It is related to what he called the logic of the situation in an Economica article of 19441945, published later in his book The Poverty of Historicism . 251  According to Poppers rationality principle, agents act in the most adequate way according to the objective situation. It is an idealized conception of human behavior which he used to drive his model of situational analysis . Probabilistic programming  PP, is a programming paradigm in which probabilistic models are specified and inference for these models is performed automatically. 252  It represents an attempt to unify probabilistic modeling and traditional general-purpose programming in order to make the former easier and more widely applicable. 253  254  It can be used to create systems that help make decisions in the face of uncertainty. Programming languages used for probabilistic programming are referred to as Probabilistic programming languages PPLs. Production system  Programming language  is a formal language , which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output . Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms . Prolog  is a logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics . 255  256  257  Prolog has its roots in first-order logic , a formal logic , and unlike many other programming languages , Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language the program logic is expressed in terms of relations, represented as facts and rules . A computation is initiated by running a query over these relations. 258  Propositional calculus  is a branch of logic . It is also called propositional logic, statement logic, sentential calculus, sentential logic, or sometimes zeroth-order logic . It deals with propositions which can be true or false and argument flow. Compound propositions are formed by connecting propositions by logical connectives . The propositions without logical connectives are called atomic propositions. Unlike first-order logic , propositional logic does not deal with non-logical objects, predicates about them, or quantifiers. However, all the machinery of propositional logic is included in first-order logic and higher-order logics. In this sense, propositional logic is the foundation of first-order logic and higher-order logic. Python  is an interpreted , high-level , general-purpose programming language . Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Pythons design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace . Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 259  Contents    Top 09 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z See also References External links Q  edit  Qualification problem  In philosophy and artificial intelligence especially, knowledge-based systems , the qualification problem is concerned with the impossibility of listing all the preconditions required for a real-world action to have its intended effect. 260  261  It might be posed as how to deal with the things that prevent me from achieving my intended result . It is strongly connected to, and opposite the ramification side of, the frame problem . 260  Quantifier  In logic , quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula . The two most common quantifiers mean  for all  and  there exists . For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that for all n where n is a natural number, there is another number say, the successor of n which is one bigger than n. Quantum computing  is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation . A quantum computer is used to perform such computation, which can be implemented theoretically or physically. 262   I-5 Query language  Query languages or data query languages DQLs are computer languages used to make queries in databases and information systems . Broadly, query languages can be classified according to whether they are database query languages or information retrieval query languages . The difference is that a database query language attempts to give factual answers to factual questions, while an information retrieval query language attempts to find documents containing information that is relevant to an area of inquiry. R  edit  R programming language  is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. 263  The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software 264  and data analysis . 265  Radial basis function network  In the field of mathematical modeling , a radial basis function network is an artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions . The output of the network is a linear combination of radial basis functions of the inputs and neuron parameters. Radial basis function networks have many uses, including function approximation , time series prediction , classification , and system control . They were first formulated in a 1988 paper by Broomhead and Lowe, both researchers at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment . 266  267  268  Random forest  Random forests, or random decision forests, are an ensemble learning method for classification , regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes classification or mean prediction regression of the individual trees. 269  270  Random decision forests correct for decision trees habit of overfitting to their training set . 271  Reasoning system  In information technology a reasoning system is a software system that generates conclusions from available knowledge using logical techniques such as deduction and induction . Reasoning systems play an important role in the implementation of artificial intelligence and knowledge-based systems . Recurrent neural network  RNN, is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks , RNNs can use their internal state memory to process sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition 272  or speech recognition . 273  274  Region connection calculus  Reinforcement learning  RL, is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning . It differs from supervised learning in that labelled inputoutput pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration of uncharted territory and exploitation of current knowledge. 275  Reservoir computing  is a framework for computation that may be viewed as an extension of neural networks . 276  Typically an input signal is fed into a fixed random dynamical system called a reservoir and the dynamics of the reservoir map the input to a higher dimension. Then a simple readout mechanism is trained to read the state of the reservoir and map it to the desired output. The main benefit is that training is performed only at the readout stage and the reservoir is fixed. Liquid-state machines 277  and echo state networks 278  are two major types of reservoir computing. 279  Resource Description Framework  RDF, is a family of World Wide Web Consortium W3C specifications 280  originally designed as a metadata data model . It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources , using a variety of syntax notations and data serialization formats. It is also used in knowledge management applications. Restricted Boltzmann machine  RBM, is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.

Robotics deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots , as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback , and information processing . Rule-based system  In computer science , a rule-based system is used to store and manipulate knowledge to interpret information in a useful way. It is often used in artificial intelligence applications and research. Normally, the term rule-based system is applied to systems involving human-crafted or curated rule sets. Rule-based systems constructed using automatic rule inference, such as rule-based machine learning , are normally excluded from this system type. S  edit  Satisfiability  In mathematical logic , satisfiability and validity are elementary concepts of semantics . A formula is satisfiable if it is possible to find an interpretation  model  that makes the formula true. 281  A formula is valid if all interpretations make the formula true. The opposites of these concepts are unsatisfiability and invalidity, that is, a formula is unsatisfiable if none of the interpretations make the formula true, and invalid if some such interpretation makes the formula false. These four concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to Aristotle s square of opposition . Search algorithm  is any algorithm which solves the search problem , namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain , either with discrete or continuous values . Selection  is the stage of a genetic algorithm in which individual genomes are chosen from a population for later breeding using the crossover operator . Self-management  is the process by which computer systems shall manage their own operation without human intervention. Semantic network  or frame network, is a knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network. This is often used as a form of knowledge representation . It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices , which represent concepts , and edges , which represent semantic relations between concepts, 282  mapping or connecting semantic fields . Semantic reasoner A semantic reasoner, reasoning engine, rules engine, or simply a reasoner, is a piece of software able to infer logical consequences from a set of asserted facts or axioms . The notion of a semantic reasoner generalizes that of an inference engine , by providing a richer set of mechanisms to work with. The inference rules are commonly specified by means of an ontology language , and often a description logic language. Many reasoners use first-order predicate logic to perform reasoning inference commonly proceeds by forward chaining and backward chaining . Semantic query  allows for queries and analytics of associative and contextual nature. Semantic queries enable the retrieval of both explicitly and implicitly derived information based on syntactic, semantic and structural information contained in data. They are designed to deliver precise results possibly the distinctive selection of one single piece of information or to answer more fuzzy and wide open questions through pattern matching and digital reasoning . Semantics  In programming language theory , semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages . It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language, showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings, the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program, or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform , hence creating a model of computation . Sensor fusion  is combining of sensory data or data derived from disparate sources such that the resulting information has less uncertainty than would be possible when these sources were used individually. Separation logic  is an extension of Hoare logic , a way of reasoning about programs. The assertion language of separation logic is a special case of the logic of bunched implications BI. 283  Similarity learning  is an area of supervised machine learning in artificial intelligence. It is closely related to regression and classification , but the goal is to learn from a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking , in recommendation systems , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Simulated annealing  SA, is a probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function . Specifically, it is a metaheuristic to approximate global optimization in a large search space for an optimization problem . Situated approach  In artificial intelligence research, the situated approach builds agents that are designed to behave effectively successfully in their environment. This requires designing AI from the bottom-up by focussing on the basic perceptual and motor skills required to survive. The situated approach gives a much lower priority to abstract reasoning or problem-solving skills. Situation calculus  is a logic formalism designed for representing and reasoning about dynamical domains. SLD resolution   Selective Linear Definite clause resolution, is the basic inference rule used in logic programming . It is a refinement of resolution , which is both sound and refutation complete for Horn clauses .

This is in contrast to physical hardware , from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering , computer software is all information processed by computer systems , programs and data . Computer software includes computer programs , libraries and related non-executable data , such as online documentation or digital media .

It incorporates knowledge and research in the linguistics , computer science , and electrical engineering fields. Spiking neural network  SNNs, are artificial neural network s that more closely mimic natural neural networks. 289  In addition to neuronal and synaptic state, SNNs incorporate the concept of time into their operating model . State  In information technology and computer science , a program is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions 290  the remembered information is called the state of the system. Statistical classification  In machine learning and statistics , classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories sub-populations a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations or instances whose category membership is known. Examples are assigning a given email to the spam or non-spam class, and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient sex, blood pressure, presence or absence of certain symptoms, etc.. Classification is an example of pattern recognition . Statistical relational learning  SRL, is a subdiscipline of artificial intelligence and machine learning that is concerned with domain models that exhibit both uncertainty which can be dealt with using statistical methods and complex, relational structure. 291  292  Note that SRL is sometimes called Relational Machine Learning RML in the literature. Typically, the knowledge representation formalisms developed in SRL use a subset of first-order logic to describe relational properties of a domain in a general manner  universal quantification  and draw upon probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks or Markov networks  to model the uncertainty some also build upon the methods of inductive logic programming . Stochastic optimization  Stochastic optimization, SO, methods are optimization methods that generate and use random variables . For stochastic problems, the random variables appear in the formulation of the optimization problem itself, which involves random objective functions or random constraints. Stochastic optimization methods also include methods with random iterates. Some stochastic optimization methods use random iterates to solve stochastic problems, combining both meanings of stochastic optimization. 293  Stochastic optimization methods generalize deterministic methods for deterministic problems. Stochastic semantic analysis  is an approach used in computer science as a semantic component of natural language understanding . Stochastic models generally use the definition of segments of words as basic semantic units for the semantic models, and in some cases involve a two layered approach. 294  Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver STRIPS  Subject-matter expert  Superintelligence  is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. Superintelligence may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems e.g., superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act in the world. A superintelligence may or may not be created by an intelligence explosion and associated with a technological singularity . Supervised learning  is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. 295  It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples . 296  In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object typically a vector and a desired output value also called the supervisory signal . A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a reasonable way see inductive bias . Support-vector machines  In machine learning , support-vector machines SVMs, also support-vector networks 297   are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis . Swarm intelligence  SI, is the collective behavior of decentralized , self-organized systems, natural or artificial.

The theory was developed as a geometrization of brain function especially of the central nervous system  using tensors . 305  306  TensorFlow  is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks . 307  Theoretical computer science  TCS, is a subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more mathematical topics of computing and includes the theory of computation . Theory of computation  In theoretical computer science and mathematics , the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation , using an algorithm . The field is divided into three major branches automata theory and languages, computability theory , and computational complexity theory , which are linked by the question What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers. 308  Thompson sampling  is a heuristic for choosing actions that addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in the multi-armed bandit problem. It consists in choosing the action that maximizes the expected reward with respect to a randomly drawn belief. 309  310  Time complexity  is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm . Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor . Transhumanism  abbreviated as H or h, is an international philosophical movement that advocates for the transformation of the human condition by developing and making widely available sophisticated technologies to greatly enhance human intellect and physiology. 311  312  Transition system  In theoretical computer science , a transition system is a concept used in the study of computation . It is used to describe the potential behavior of discrete systems . It consists of states and transitions between states, which may be labeled with labels chosen from a set the same label may appear on more than one transition. If the label set is a singleton , the system is essentially unlabeled, and a simpler definition that omits the labels is possible. Tree traversal  also known as tree search, is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting checking andor updating each node in a tree data structure , exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited. True quantified Boolean formula  In computational complexity theory , the language TQBF is a formal language consisting of the true quantified Boolean formulas. A fully quantified Boolean formula is a formula in quantified propositional logic where every variable is quantified or bound , using either existential or universal quantifiers, at the beginning of the sentence. Such a formula is equivalent to either true or false since there are no free variables. If such a formula evaluates to true, then that formula is in the language TQBF. It is also known as QSAT Quantified SAT . Turing test  developed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machines ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machines ability to render words as speech. 313  If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test results do not depend on the machines ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give. Type system  In programming languages , a type system is a set of rules that assigns a property called type to the various constructs of a computer program , such as variables , expressions , functions or modules . 314  These types formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types , data structures, or other components e.g. string, array of float, function returning boolean. The main purpose of a type system is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs 315  by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way. This checking can happen statically at compile time , dynamically at run time , or as a combination of static and dynamic checking. Type systems have other purposes as well, such as expressing business rules, enabling certain compiler optimizations, allowing for multiple dispatch , providing a form of documentation, etc. U  edit  Unsupervised learning  is a type of self-organized Hebbian learning that helps find previously unknown patterns in data set without pre-existing labels.
