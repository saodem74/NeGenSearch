His blog, hosted by Harvard Law School , contains his opinions on diverse subjects, from politics, to technology, to even divorce and discrimination law. 1  Contents 1 Biography 2 References 3 External links 3.1 ArsDigita histories Biography  edit  Greenspun was born on September 28, 1963, grew up in Bethesda, Maryland , and received an S.B. in Mathematics from MIT in 1982. After working for Hewlett Packard Research Labs in Palo Alto and Symbolics , he became a founder of ICAD , Inc. Greenspun returned to MIT to study electrical engineering and computer science , eventually receiving a Ph.D . Among software engineers , Greenspun is known for his Tenth Rule of Programming  Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug -ridden, slow implementation of half of Common Lisp . In 1993, Greenspun founded photo.net, an online community for people helping each other to improve their photographic skills. He seeded the community with Travels with Samantha, 2  a photo-illustrated account of a trip from Boston to Alaska and back. Photo.net became a business in 2000 with the help of some of his cofounders Rajeev Surati and Waikit Lau. Having grown to 600,000 registered users, was acquired by NameMedia in 2007 for 6 million, according to documents filed in connection with a planned public offering of NameMedia shares. 3  Greenspun released the software behind photo.net as a free open-source toolkit called the ArsDigita Community System , built on top of the Oracle relational database management system . He wrote several textbooks on developing Internet applications, including Philip and Alexs Guide to Web Publishing , 4  SQL for Web Nerds , 5  and Software Engineering for Internet Applications , 6  the textbook for an MIT course. Greenspun started a company to sell support and service contracts for the toolkit, which remained free, and grew ArsDigita to about 20 million in revenue before taking a venture capital investment. 7  Greenspun was an early developer of database-backed Web sites, which became the dominant approach to engineering sites with user contributions, e.g., Amazon.com. Greenspun was a developer of one of the first Web-based electronic medical record systems. 8  Greenspuns Oracle -based community site LUSENET was an important early host of free forums. In 1995, Greenspun was hired to lead development of Hearst Corporations Internet services, which included some early e-commerce sites. Greenspun was employed as a commercial pilot for Delta Air Lines subsidiary Comair from 2008 until it ceased operation in 2012. 9  According to the FAA Airmen registry, 10  Greenspun holds an Airline Transport Pilot License and Flight Instructor certificates for both airplanes and helicopters, as well as type ratings for two turbojet-powered airplanes. Greenspun is listed as an instructor at the East Coast Aero Club 11  and was interviewed by NPR regarding the success of a Groupon helicopter lesson offer. 12  Greenspun and his co-founders started a non-profit foundation that ran the ArsDigita Prize , an award for young web developers, and the ArsDigita University , a tuition-free one-year program teaching the core computer science curriculum, one course at a time. Winners of the Prize include a 12 year old Aaron Swartz Greenspun has taught electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. 13  One of Greenspuns most famous students is Randal Pinkett , who built an online community for low-income housing residents in Greenspuns 6.171 Software Engineering for Internet Applications course. Pinkett went on to win NBC TV show The Apprentice . In 2003, Greenspun helped teach a newly designed circuits and electronics course at MIT. 14  In 2007, Greenspun donated 20,000 to Wikimedia Foundation to start a project fund for the payment of illustrators to supply illustrations for use on Wikimedia Foundation projects. 15  16  Greenspun is a volunteer for Angel Flight and, on December 6, 2010, assisted in the first nationally arranged kidney paired-donation in which kidneys were flown from Lebanon, New Hampshire to St. Louis and vice versa. 17  In January 2011 and again in January 2012, Greenspun taught an intensive RDBMSSQL programming course at MIT using Google Docs to coordinate classroom instruction. 18  In December 2013, Greenspun donated 10,000 to Kids on Computers KOC, a 501c3 non-profit which sets up computer labs in areas where kids do not have access to technology. In recognition of Greenspuns donation, the KOC lab at Escuela Manuel Gonzalez Gatica was named the Gittes Family Lab in honor of his grandfather. 19  References  edit   httpblogs.harvard.eduphilg20150730men-in-massachusetts-should-simply-not-show-up-to-defend-restraining-orders-divorces-and-other-family-law-matters  Philip Greenspun.
