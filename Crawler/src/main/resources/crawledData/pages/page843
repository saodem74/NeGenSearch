Mike Woodger From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Michael Woodger  Jump to navigation Jump to search Mike Woodger The Pilot ACE computer, now in the Science Museum, London Born  1923-03-28  28 March 1923 Epsom , Surrey , England Citizenship British Alma  mater University College London Known  for Pilot ACE ALGOL 60 Ada programming language Scientific career Fields Computer science Institutions National Physical Laboratory Michael Mike Woodger born 28 March 1923 is a pioneering English computer scientist . He was influential in the development of the early Pilot ACE computer, working with Alan Turing , and later the design and documentation of programming languages such as ALGOL 60 and Ada . 1  He was based at the National Physical Laboratory NPL located in Teddington , London , for most of his career. 2  Mike Woodger was the eldest of four children. His father was Joseph Henry Woodger 18941981, a professor of biology at the University of London . 1  He graduated from University College London in 1943 and worked at the Ministry of Supply on military applications for the rest of the Second World War . 3  In May 1946, he then joined the new Mathematics Division at the National Physical Laboratory located in west London . At NPL, he worked with Alan Turing on the ACE computer design, 4  leading eventually to the Pilot ACE computer 5  after Turing had left NPL, first operational in 1950. 6  He later worked on programming language design, especially ALGOL 60 and Ada . 7  References  edit   a b Yates, David Spring 2010.
