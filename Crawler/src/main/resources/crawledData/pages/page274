Information model From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search An IDEF1X Diagram, an example of an Integration Definition for Information Modeling. An information model in software engineering is a representation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse. Typically it specifies relations between kinds of things, but may also include relations with individual things. It can provide sharable, stable, and organized structure of information requirements or knowledge for the domain context. 1  Contents 1 Overview 2 Information modeling languages 3 Standard sets of information models 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References 7 Further reading 8 External links Overview  edit  The term information model in general is used for models of individual things, such as facilities, buildings, process plants, etc. In those cases the concept is specialised to facility information model , building information model , plant information model, etc. Such an information model is an integration of a model of the facility with the data and documents about the facility. Within the field of software engineering and data modeling an information model is usually an abstract, formal representation of entity types that may include their properties, relationships and the operations that can be performed on them. The entity types in the model may be kinds of real-world objects, such as devices in a network, or occurrences, or they may themselves be abstract, such as for the entities used in a billing system . Typically, they are used to model a constrained domain that can be described by a closed set of entity types, properties, relationships and operations. An information model provides formalism to the description of a problem domain without constraining how that description is mapped to an actual implementation in software. There may be many mappings of the information model. Such mappings are called data models , irrespective of whether they are object models e.g. using UML , entity relationship models or XML schemas . Information modeling languages  edit  A sample ER diagram . Database requirements for a CD collection in EXPRESS-G notation. In 1976, an entity-relationship ER graphic notation was introduced by Peter Chen . He stressed that it was a semantic modelling technique and independent of any database modelling techniques such as Hierarchical, CODASYL, Relational etc. 2  Since then, languages for information models have continued to evolve. Some examples are the Integrated Definition Language 1 Extended  IDEF1X , the EXPRESS language and the Unified Modeling Language UML. 1  Research by contemporaries of Peter Chen such as J.R.Abrial 1974 and G.M Nijssen 1976 led to todays Fact Oriented Modeling FOM languages which are based on linguistic propositions rather than on entities. FOM tools can be used to generate an ER model which means that the modeler can avoid the time-consuming and error prone practice of manual normalization. Object-Role Modeling language  ORM  and Fully Communication Oriented Information Modeling  FCO-IM  are both research results, based upon earlier research. In the 1980s there were several approaches to extend Chens Entity Relationship Model. Also important in this decade is REMORA by Colette Rolland . 3  The ICAM Definition IDEF Language was developed from the U.S. Air Force ICAM Program during the 1976 to 1982 timeframe. 4  The objective of the ICAM Program, according to Lee 1999, was to increase manufacturing productivity through the systematic application of computer technology. IDEF includes three different modeling methods IDEF0 , IDEF1 , and IDEF2 for producing a functional model, an information model, and a dynamic model respectively. IDEF1X is an extended version of IDEF1. The language is in the public domain. It is a graphical representation and is designed using the ER approach and the relational theory. It is used to represent the real world in terms of entities, attributes, and relationships between entities. Normalization is enforced by KEY Structures and KEY Migration. The language identifies property gro upings Aggregation to form complete entity definitions. 1  EXPRESS was created as ISO 10303-11 for formally specifying information requirements of product data model. It is part of a suite of standards informally known as the STandard for the Exchange of Product model data STEP. It was first introduced in the early 1990s. 5  6  The language, according to Lee 1999, is a textual representation. In addition, a graphical subset of EXPRESS called EXPRESS-G is available. EXPRESS is based on programming languages and the O-O paradigm. A number of languages have contributed to EXPRESS. In particular, Ada, Algol, C, C, Euler, Modula-2, Pascal, PL1, and SQL. EXPRESS consists of language elements that allo w an unambiguous object definition and specification of constraints on the objects defined. It uses SCHEMA declaration to provide partitioning and it supports specification of data properties, constraints, and operations. 1  UML is a modeling language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts, rather than processes, of software systems. It was conceived originally by Grady Booch , James Rumbaugh , and Ivar Jacobson . UML was approved by the Object Management Group OMG as a standard in 1997. The language, according to Lee 1999, is non-proprietary and is available to the public. It is a graphical representation. The language is based on the objected-oriented paradigm. UML contains notations and rules and is designed to represent data requirements in terms of O-O diagrams. UML organizes a model in a number of views that present differe nt aspects of a system. The contents of a view are described in diagrams that are graphs with model elements. A diagram contains model elements that represent common O-O concepts such as classes, objects, messages, and relationships among these concepts. 1  IDEF1X, EXPRESS, and UML all can be used to create a conceptual model and, according to Lee 1999, each has its own characteristics. Although some may lead to a natural usage e.g., implementation, one is not necessarily better than another. In practice, it may require more than one language to develop all information models when an application is complex. In fact, the modeli ng practice is often more important than the language chosen. 1  Information models can also be expressed in formalized natural languages, such as Gellish . Gellish, which has natural language variants Gellish Formal English , Gellish Formal Dutch Gellish Formeel Nederlands , etc. is an information representation language or modeling language that is defined in the Gellish smart Dictionary-Taxonomy, which has the form of a Taxonomy  Ontology . A Gellish Database is not only suitable to store information models, but also knowledge models, requirements models and dictionaries, taxonomies and ontologies. Information models in Gellish English use Gellish Formal English expressions. For example, a geographic information model might consist of a number of Gellish Formal English expressions, such as - the Eiffel tower is located in  Paris - Paris is classified as a  city whereas information requirements and knowledge can be expressed for example as follows - tower shall be located in a  geographical area - city is a kind of  geographical area Such Gellish expressions use names of concepts such as city and relation types such as is located in  and is classified as a  that should be selected from the Gellish Formal English Dictionary-Taxonomy or of your own domain dictionary. The Gellish English Dictionary-Taxonomy enables the creation of semantically rich information models, because the dictionary contains definitions of more than 40000 concepts, including more than 600 standard relation types. Thus, an information model in Gellish con sists of a collection of Gellish expressions that use those phrases and dictionary concepts to express facts or make statements, queries and answers. Standard sets of information models  edit  The Distributed Management Task Force DMTF provides a standard set of information models for various enterprise domains under the general title of the Common Information Model CIM. Specific information models are derived from CIM for particular management domains. The TeleManagement Forum TMF has defined an advanced model for the Telecommunication domain the Shared InformationData model , or SID as another. This includes views from the business, service and resource domains within the Telecommunication industry. The TMF has established a set of principles that an OSS integration should adopt, along with a set of models that provide standardized approaches. The models interact with the information model the Shared InformationData Model , or SID, via a process model the Business Process Framework eTOM , or eTOM and a life cycle model.
