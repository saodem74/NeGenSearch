Its origin and development was in Japan, largely in the 1960s and 1970s and particularly at Toyota. 1   page  needed   disputed  discuss  , 2   page  needed   disputed  discuss  Alternative terms for JIT manufacturing have been used. Motorola s choice was short-cycle manufacturing SCM. 3  4  IBMs was continuous-flow manufacturing CFM, 5  6  and demand-flow manufacturing DFM, a term handed down from consultant John Constanza at his Institute of Technology in Colorado. 7  Still another alternative was mentioned by Goddard, who said that Toyota Production System is often mistakenly referred to as the Kanban System, and pointed out that kanban is but one element of TPS, as well as JIT production. 8   11 But the wide use of the term JIT manufacturing throughout the 1980s faded fast in the 1990s, as the new term lean manufacturing became established 9   page  needed  , 10   need quotation to verify  as a more recent name for JIT. 11  As just one testament to the commonality of the two terms, Toyota production system TPS has been and is widely used as a synonym for both JIT and lean manufacturing. 12   citation needed  , 13  Contents 1 History 1.1 Evolution in Japan 1.2 Migration to the West 1.3 Middle era and to the present 2 Methodology 3 Objectives and benefits 4 Potential risks 5 See also 6 Further reading 7 References History  edit  Evolution in Japan  edit  The exact reasons for adoption of JIT in Japan are unclear. Plenert offers four reasons, paraphrased here. During Japans post-World War II rebuilding of industry 1 Japans lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere. 2 Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. 3 The Japanes e islands were and are lacking in natural resources with which to build products. 4 Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus the Japanese leaned out their processes. They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased. Plenart goes on to explain Toyotas key role in developing this lean or JIT production methodology. 14  Migration to the West  edit  News about JITTPS reached western shores in 1977 in two English-language articles one referred to the methodology as the Ohno system, after Taiichi Ohno , who was instrumental in its development within Toyota. 15  The other article, by Toyota authors in an international journal, provided additional details. 16  Finally, those and other publicity were translated into implementations, beginning in 1980 and then quickly multiplying throughout industry in the United States and other developed countries. A seminal 1980 event was a conference in Detroit at Ford World Headquarters co-sponsored by the Repetitive Manufacturing Group RMG, which had been founded 1979 within the American Produ ction and Inventory Control Society APICS to seek advances in manufacturing. The principle speaker, Fujio Cho later, president of Toyota Motor Corp., in explaining the Toyota system, stirred up the audience, and led to the RMGs shifting gears from things like automation to JITTPS. 17  At least some of audiences stirring had to do with a perceived clash between the new JIT regime and manufacturing resource planning MRP II, a computer software-based system of manufacturing planning and control which had become prominent in industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Debates in professional meetings on JIT vs. MRP II were followed by published articles, one of them titled, The Rise and Fall of Just-in-Time. 18  Less confrontational was Walt Goddards, Kanban Versus MRP IIWhich Is Best for You in 1982. 19  Four years later, Goddard had answered his own question with a book advocating JIT. 8  Among the best known of MRP IIs advocates was George Plossl, who authored two articles questioning JITs kanban planning method 20  and the japanning of America. 21  But, as with Goddard, Plossl later wrote that JIT is a concept whose time has come. 22  JITTPS implementations may be found in many case-study articles from the 1980s and beyond. An article in a 1984 issue of Inc . magazine 23  relates how Omark Industries chain saws, ammunition, log loaders, etc. emerged as an extensive JIT implementer under its US home-grown name ZIPS zero inventory production system. At Omarks mother plant in Portland, Oregon , after the work force had received 40 hours of ZIPS training, they were turned loose and things began to happen. A first step was to arbitrarily eliminate a weeks lead time after which things ran smoother. People asked that we try taking another weeks worth out. After that, ZIPS spread throughout the plants operations like an amoeba. The article also notes that Om arks 20 other plants were similarly engaged in ZIPS, beginning with pilot projects. For example, at one of Omarks smaller plants making drill bits in Mesabi, Minnesota , large-size drill inventory was cut by 92, productivity increased by 30, scrap and rework ... dropped 20, and lead time ... from order to finished product was slashed from three weeks to three days. The Inc . article states that companies using JIT the most extensively include the Big Four, Hewlett-Packard , Motorola, Westinghouse Electric , General Electric , Deere , and Black and Decker . By 1986, a case-study book on JIT in the U.S. 24  was able to devote a full chapter to ZIPS at Omark, along with two chapters on JIT at several Hewlett-Packard plants, and single chapters for Harley-Davidson, John Deere, IBM-Raleigh, North Carolina, and California-based Apple Computers, a Toyota truck-bed plant, and New United Motor Manufacturing joint venture between Toyota and General Motors. Two similarly-inclined books emergent in the U.K. in the same years are more international in scope. 25  One of the books, with both conceptual articles and case studies, includes three sections on JIT practices in Japan e.g., at Toyota, Mazda, and Tokagawa Electric in Europe jmg Bostrom, Lucas Electric, Cummins Engine, IBM, 3M, Datasolve Ltd., Renault, Massey-Ferguson and in the USA and Australia Repco Manufacturing-Australia, Xerox Computer, and two on Hewlett-Packard. The second book, reporting on what was billed as the First International Conference on just-in-time manufacturing, 26  includes case studies in three companies Repco-Australia, IBM-UK, and 3M-UK. In addition, a day-2 keynote discussed JIT as applied across all disciplines, ... from accounting and systems to design and production. 26   J1J9 Middle era and to the present  edit  Three more books which include JIT implementations were published in 1993, 27  1995, 28  and 1996, 29  which are start-up years of the lean manufacturinglean management movement that was launched in 1990 with publication of the book, The Machine That Changed the World . 30  That one, along with other books, articles, and case studies on lean, were supplanting JIT terminology in the 1990s and beyond. The same period, saw the rise of books and articles with similar concepts and methodologies but with alternative names, including cycle time management , 31  time-based competition , 32  quick-response manufacturing , 33  flow, 34  and pull-based production systems . 35  There is more to JIT than its usual manufacturing-centered explication. Inasmuch as manufacturing ends with order-fulfillment to distributors, retailers, and end users, and also includes remanufacturing, repair, and warranty claims, JITs concepts and methods have application downstream from manufacturing itself. A 1993 book on world-class distribution logistics discusses kan ban links from factories onward. 36  And a manufacturer-to-retailer model developed in the U.S. in the 1980s, referred to as quick response , 37  has morphed over time to what is called fast fashion . 38  39  Methodology  edit  Sepheri provides a list of methodologies of JIT manufacturing that are important but not exhaustive 40  Housekeeping  physical organization and discipline. Make it right the first time  elimination of defects. Setup reduction  flexible changeover approaches. Lot sizes of one  the ultimate lot size and flexibility.

Objectives and benefits  edit  Objectives and benefits of JIT manufacturing may be stated in two primary ways first, in specific and quantitative terms, via published case studies second, general listings and discussion. A case-study summary from Daman Products in 1999 lists the following benefits reduced cycle times 97, setup times 50, lead times from 4 to 8 weeks to 5 to 10 days, flow distance 90  achieved via four focused cellular factories, pull scheduling, kanban, visual management, and employee empowerment. 41  Another study from NCR Dundee Scotland in 1998, a producer of make-to-order automated teller machines, includes some of the same benefits while also focusing on JIT purchasing In switching to JIT over a weekend in 1998, eliminated buffer inventories, reducing inventory from 47 days to 5 days, flow time from 15 days to 2 days, with 60 of purchased parts arriving JIT and 77 going dock to line, and suppliers reduced from 480 to 165. 42  Hewlett-Packard, one of western industrys earliest JIT implementers, provides a set of four case studies from four H-P divisions during the mid-1980s. 43  The four divisions, Greeley, Fort Collins, Computer Systems, and Vancouver, employed some but not all of the same measures. At the time about half of H-Ps 52 divisions had adopted JIT.

When ordering small quantities of materials, suppliers minimum order policies may pose a problem, though. 44  Employees are at risk of precarious work when employed by factories that utilize just-in-time and flexible production techniques. A longitudinal study of US workers since 1970 indicates employers seeking to easily adjust their  workforce in response to supply and demand  conditions respond by creating more nonstandard work arrangements, such as contracting and temporary work. 45  Natural and man-made disasters will disrupt the flow of energy, goods and services. The down-stream customers of those goods and services will, in turn, not be able to produce their product or render their service because they were counting on incoming deliveries just in time and so have little or no inventory to work with. The disruption to the economic system will cascade to some degree depending on the nature and severity of the original disaster. 46  47  The larger the disaster the worse the effect on just-in-time failures. Electrical power is the ultimate example of just-in-time delivery. A severe geomagnetic storm could disrupt electrical power delivery for hours to years, locally or even globally. Lack of supplies on hand to repair the electrical system would have catastrophic effects. 48  See also  edit  CONWIP Just in case manufacturing Just-in-time compilation Ovsiankina effect Theory of constraints Total quality management Further reading  edit  Billesbach, Thomas J. 1987.
