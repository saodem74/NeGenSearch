Aramid From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Heat-resistant and strong aromatic polyamide Structure of Twaron and Kevlar , both para -aramid Aramid fibers are a class of heat-resistant and strong synthetic fibers . They are used in aerospace and military applications, for ballistic-rated body armor fabric and ballistic composites, in bicycle tires, marine cordage , marine hull reinforcement, and as an asbestos substitute. 1  The name is a portmanteau of  aromatic polyamide . The chain molecules in the fibers are highly oriented along the fiber axis. As a result, a higher proportion of the chemical bond contributes more to fiber strength than in many other synthetic fibers. Aramides have a very high melting point  500 C Contents 1 History 2 Health 3 Production 3.1 Polymer preparation 3.2 Spinning 3.3 Appearances 4 Other types of aramids 5 Aramid fiber characteristics 5.1 General 5.2 Para-aramids 6 Uses 7 See also 8 Notes and references 9 Further reading History  edit  Aromatic polyamides were first introduced in commercial applications in the early 1960s, with a meta -aramid fiber produced by DuPont as HT-1 and then under the trade name Nomex . 2  This fiber, which handles similarly to normal textile apparel fibers, is characterized by its excellent resistance to heat, as it neither melts nor ignites in normal levels of oxygen. It is used extensively in the production of protective apparel, air filtration, thermal and electrical insulation, as well as a substitute for asbestos . Meta-aramid is also produced in the Netherlands and Japan by Teijin Aramid under the trade name Teijinconex, 2  in Korea by Toray under the trade name Arawin, in China by Yantai Tayho under the trade name New Star, by SRO Group China under the trade name X-Fiper, and a variant of meta-aramid in France by Kermel under the trade name Kermel. Based on earlier research by Monsanto Company and Bayer , para -aramid fiber with much higher tenacity and elastic modulus was also developed in the 1960s and 1970s by DuPont and AkzoNobel , both profiting from their knowledge of rayon , polyester and nylon processing. In 1973 DuPont was the first company to introduce a para-aramid fiber, which it called Kevlar , to the market this remains one of the best-known para-aramids andor aramids. In 1978, Akzo introduced a similar fiber with roughly the same chemical structure, which it called Twaron . Due to earlier patents on the production process, Akzo and DuPont engaged in a patent dispute in the 1980s. Twaron subsequently came under the ownership of the Teijin Company. In 2011, Yantai Tayho introduced similar fiber which is called Taparan in China see Production . Para-aramids are used in many high-tech applications, such as aerospace and military applications, for bullet-proof body armor fabric . Both meta-aramid and para-aramid fiber can be used to make aramid paper. Aramid paper can be used as electrical insulation materials and construction materials to make honeycomb core. Dupont made aramid paper in 1960s, which is called Nomex paper. Yantai Metastar Special Paper introduced aramid paper in 2007, which is called metastar paper. Both Dupont and Yantai Metastar can make meta-aramid and para-aramid paper. The Federal Trade Commission definition for aramid fiber is A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming substance is a long-chain synthetic polyamide in which at least 85 of the amide linkages, CONH are attached directly to two aromatic rings. 3  Health  edit  During the 1990s, an in vitro test of aramid fibers showed they exhibited many of the same effects on epithelial cells as did asbestos , including increased radiolabeled nucleotide incorporation into DNA and induction of ODC  ornithine decarboxylase  enzyme activity, raising the possibility of carcinogenic implications. 4  However, in 2009, it was shown that inhaled aramid fibrils are shortened and quickly cleared from the body and pose little risk. 5  A declaration of interest correction was later provided by the author of the study stating that This review was commissioned and funded by DuPont and Teijin Aramid, but the author alone was responsible for the content and writing of the paper. 6  Production  edit  World capacity of para-aramid production was estimated at about 41,000 tonnes per year in 2002 and increases each year by 510. 7  In 2007 this means a total production capacity of around 55,000 tonnes per year. Polymer preparation  edit  Aramids are generally prepared by the reaction between an amine group and a carboxylic acid halide group. Simple AB homopolymers may look like n NH 2 ArCOCl  NHArCO n   n HCl The most well-known aramids  Kevlar , Twaron , Nomex , New Star and Teijinconex are AABB polymers. Nomex, Teijinconex and New Star contain predominantly the meta-linkage and are poly- metaphenylene isophthalamide s MPIA. Kevlar and Twaron are both p -phenylene terephthalamides PPTA, the simplest form of the AABB para-polyaramide. PPTA is a product of p -phenylene diamine  PPD  and terephthaloyl dichloride TDC or TCl . Production of PPTA relies on a co-solvent with an ionic component  calcium chloride , CaCl 2  to occupy the hydrogen bonds of the amide groups, and an organic component  N-methyl pyrrolidone, NMP  to dissolve the aromatic polymer . This process was invented by Leo Vollbracht, who worked at the Dutch chemical firm Akzo . Apart from the carcinogenic hexamethylphosphorous triamide  HMPT , still no practical alternative of dissolving the polymer is known. The use of the NMPCaCl 2 system led to an extended patent dispute between Akzo and DuPont. Spinning  edit  After production of the polymer, the aramid fiber is produced by spinning the dissolved polymer to a solid fiber from a liquid chemical blend. Polymer solvent for spinning PPTA is generally 100 anhydrous sulfuric acid H 2 SO 4 . Appearances  edit  Fiber Chopped fiber Powder Pulp Other types of aramids  edit  Besides meta-aramids like Nomex, other variations belong to the aramid fiber range. These are mainly of the copolyamide type, best known under the brand name Technora , as developed by Teijin and introduced in 1976. The manufacturing process of Technora reacts PPD and 3,4-diaminodiphenylether 3,4-ODA with terephthaloyl chloride TCl . 8  This relatively simple process uses only one amide solvent, and therefore spinning can be done directly after the polymer production. Aramid fiber characteristics  edit  Aramids share a high degree of orientation with other fibers such as ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene , a characteristic that dominates their properties. General  edit  good resistance to abrasion good resistance to organic solvents nonconductive very high melting point  500 C low flammability good fabric integrity at elevated temperatures sensitive to acids and salts sensitive to ultraviolet radiation prone to electrostatic charge build-up unless finished 9  Para-aramids  edit  para-aramid fibers, such as Kevlar and Twaron, provide outstanding strength-to-weight properties high Chord modulus high tenacity low creep low elongation at break 3.5 difficult to dye  usually solution-dyed 9  Uses  edit  flame-resistant clothing for example, military MIL-G-181188B suits. heat-protective clothing and helmets body armor , 10  competing with PE -based fiber products such as Dyneema and Spectra composite materials asbestos replacement e.g. brake linings  hot air filtration fabrics tires , newly as Sulfron sulfur-modified Twaron  mechanical rubber goods reinforcement ropes and cables wicks for fire dancing optical fiber cable systems sail cloth not necessarily racing boat sails sporting goods drumheads wind instrument reeds , such as the Fibracell brand loudspeaker diaphragms boathull material fiber-reinforced concrete reinforced thermoplastic pipes tennis strings e.g. by Ashaway and Prince tennis companies hockey sticks normally in composition with such materials as wood and carbon snowboards jet engine enclosures Fishing Reel Drag systems Asphalt reinforcement Prusiks for rock climbers which slide along the main rope and can otherwise melt due to friction.
