The Council became the IEEE Technology Engineering and Management Society TEMS as of 1 January 2015. Contents 1 History 2 Field of interest 2.1 Publications 2.2 Conferences 3 Governance 4 References 5 External links History  edit  The Professional Group on Engineering Management was established under the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1951. This group became the Engineering Management Society EMS of the IEEE in 1955. In 2007 this became the IEEE Technology Management Council TMC and in January 2015 the Technology Engineering and Management Society. Field of interest  edit  The field of interest encompasses the management sciences and practices required for defining, implementing, and managing engineering and technology. Publications  edit  The society publishes two peer-reviewed journals the Transactions on Engineering Management and the Engineering Management Review . Society also publishes a popular newsletter and magazine   IEEE Leader Conferences  edit  The society sponsors and co-sponsors a number of internationally-held conferences and events on subjects relevant to its field of interest the flagship one being TEMSCON . 1  2  Governance  edit  The society is governed by an Administrative Committee consisting of officers and members, most of whom are elected by the membership. In addition, the society has Technical Committees dealing with the major management issues.
