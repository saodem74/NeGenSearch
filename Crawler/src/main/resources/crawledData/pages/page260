The system integrator integrates discrete systems utilizing a variety of techniques such as computer networking , enterprise application integration , business process management or manual programming . 4  System integration involves integrating existing, often disparate systems in such a way that focuses on increasing value to the customer 5  e.g., improved product quality and performance while at the same time providing value to the company e.g., reducing operational costs and improving response time. 5  In the modern world connected by Internet , the role of system integration engineers is important more and more systems are designed to connect, both within the system under construction and to systems that are already deployed. 6  Contents 1 Methods of integration 2 See also 3 References 4 External links Methods of integration  edit  Vertical integration as opposed to horizontal integration is the process of integrating subsystems according to their functionality by creating functional entities also referred to as silos . 7  The benefit of this method is that the integration is performed quickly and involves only the necessary vendors, therefore, this method is cheaper in the short term. On the other hand, cost-of-ownership can be substantially higher than seen in other methods, since in case of new or enhanced functionality, the only possible way to implement scale the system would be by implem enting another silo. Reusing subsystems to create another functionality is not possible. 8  Star integration , also known as spaghetti integration , is a process of systems integration where each system is interconnected to each of the remaining subsystems. When observed from the perspective of the subsystem which is being integrated, the connections are reminiscent of a star, but when the overall diagram of the system is presented, the connections look like spaghetti, hence the name of this method. The cost varies becaus e of the interfaces that subsystems are exporting. In a case where the subsystems are exporting heterogeneous or proprietary interfaces, the integration cost can substantially rise. Time and costs needed to integrate the systems increase exponentially when adding additional subsystems. From the feature perspective, this method often seems preferable, due to the extreme flexibil ity of the reuse of functionality. 8  Horizontal integration or Enterprise Service Bus ESB is an integration method in which a specialized subsystem is dedicated to communication between other subsystems. This allows cutting the number of connections interfaces to only one per subsystem which will connect directly to the ESB. The ESB is capable of translating the interface into another interface. This allows cutting the costs of integration and provides extr eme flexibility. With systems integrated using this method, it is possible to completely replace one subsystem with another subsystem which provides similar functionality but exports different interfaces, all this completely transparent for the rest of the subsystems. The only action required is to implement the new interface between the ESB and the new subsystem. 8  The horizontal scheme can be misleading, however, if it is thought that the cost of intermediate data transformation or the cost of shifting responsibility over business logic can be avoided. 8  A common data format is an integration method to avoid every adapter having to convert data tofrom every other applications formats, Enterprise application integration EAI systems usually stipulate an application-independent or common data format. 9  The EAI system usually provides a data transformation service as well to help convert between application-specific and common formats. This is done in two steps the adapter converts information from the applications format to the buss common format. Then, semantic transformations are applied on this converting zip codes to city names, splittingmerging objects from one app lication into objects in the other applications, and so on.
