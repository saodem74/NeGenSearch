Founded on 23 February 1947, the organization promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial standards . It is headquartered in Geneva , Switzerland, 3  and works in 164 countries. 1  It was one of the first organizations granted general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council .

It is the worlds largest developer of voluntary international standards and facilitates world trade by providing common standards between nations. Over twenty thousand standards have been set covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture and healthcare. 3  Use of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally. 3  Language usage  edit  The three official languages of the ISO are English , French , and Russian . 2  Name and abbreviations  edit  The name of the organization in French is Organisation internationale de normalisation , and in Russian,      Mezhdunarodnaya organizatsiya po standartizatsii . ISO is not an acronym . The organization adopted ISO as its abbreviated name in reference to the Greek word isos   , meaning equal, 4  as its name in the three official languages would have different acronyms. During the founding meetings of the new organization, the Greek word explanation was not invoked, so this meaning may have been made public later. 5  ISO gives this explanation of the name Because International Organization for Standardization would have different acronyms in different languages IOS in English, OIN in French, our founders decided to give it the short form ISO . ISO is derived from the Greek isos , meaning equal. Whatever the country, whatever the language, the short form of our name is always ISO . 6  Both the name ISO and the ISO logo are registered trademarks, and their use is restricted. 7  History  edit  Plaque marking the building in Prague where the ISOs predecessor, the ISA, was founded. The organization today known as ISO began in 1928  dubious  discuss  as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations ISA. It was suspended in 1942 8  during World War  II , but after the war ISA was approached by the recently formed United Nations Standards Coordinating Committee UNSCC with a proposal to form a new global standards body. In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organization for Standardization the new organization officially began operat ions in February 1947. 9  Structure  edit  ISO is a voluntary organization whose members are recognized authorities on standards, each one representing one country. Members meet annually at a General Assembly to discuss ISOs strategic objectives. The organization is coordinated by a Central Secretariat based in Geneva . 10  A Council with a rotating membership of 20 member bodies provides guidance and governance, including setting the Central Secretariats annual budget. 10  11  The Technical Management Board is responsible for over 250 technical committees , who develop the ISO standards. 10  12  13  14  IEC joint committees  edit  ISO has formed two joint committees with the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC to develop standards and terminology in the areas of electrical and electronic related technologies. ISOIEC JTC 1  edit  Main article ISOIEC JTC 1 ISOIEC Joint Technical Committee 1 JTC 1 was created in 1987 to develop, maintain, promote and facilitate IT standards, 15  where IT refers to information technology. ISOIEC JTC 2  edit  ISOIEC Joint Technical Committee 2 JTC 2 was created in 2009 for the purpose of standardization in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. 16  Membership  edit  Further information Countries in the International Organization for Standardization    ISO member countries with a national standards body and ISO voting rights.    Correspondent members countries without a national standards body.    Subscriber members countries with small economies. ISO has 163 national members . 1  ISO has three membership categories 1  Member bodies are national bodies considered the most representative standards body in each country. These are the only members of ISO that have voting rights. Correspondent members are countries that do not have their own standards organization. These members are informed about ISOs work, but do not participate in standards promulgation. Subscriber members are countries with small economies. They pay reduced membership fees, but can follow the development of standards. Participating members are called P members, as opposed to observing members, who are called O members. Financing  edit  ISO is funded by a combination of 17  Organizations that manage the specific projects or loan experts to participate in the technical work. Subscriptions from member bodies. These subscriptions are in proportion to each countrys gross national product and trade figures. Sale of standards. International Standards and other publications  edit  See also List of International Organization for Standardization standards ISOs main products are international standards. ISO also publishes technical reports, technical specifications, publicly available specifications, technical corrigenda , and guides. 18  19  International standards These are designated using the format ISOIEC ASTM IS nnnnn-pyyyy Title , where nnnnn is the number of the standard, p is an optional part number, yyyy is the year published, and Title describes the subject. IEC for International Electrotechnical Commission is included if the standard results from the work of ISOIEC JTC1 the ISOIEC Joint Technical Committee. ASTM American Society for Testing and Materials is used for standards developed in cooperation with ASTM International . yyyy and IS are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and may under some circumstances be left off the title of a published work. Technical reports These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard, 18  such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except TR prepended instead of IS in the reports name. For example ISOIEC TR 177992000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management ISOTR 190332000 Technical product documentation  Metadata for construction documentation Technical and publicly available specifications Technical specifications may be produced when the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard. A publicly available specification is usually an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a dual logo publication published in collaboration with an external organization. 18  By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organizations technical reports. For example ISOTS 16952-12006 Technical product documentation  Reference designation system  Part 1 General application rules ISOPAS 111542006 Road vehicles  Roof load carriers Technical corrigenda ISO also sometimes issues technical corrigenda where corrigenda is the plural of corrigendum . These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review. 18  ISO guides These are meta-standards covering matters related to international standardization. 18  They are named using the format ISOIEC Guide Nyyyy Title . For example ISOIEC Guide 22004 Standardization and related activities  General vocabulary ISOIEC Guide 651996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification Document copyright  edit  ISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards. Some standards by ISO and its official U.S. representative and, via the U .S. National Committee, the International Electrotechnical Commission  are made freely available. 20  21  Standardization process  edit  A standard published by ISOIEC is the last stage of a long process that commonly starts with the proposal of new work within a committee.

ISOIEC directives allow also the so-called Fast-track procedure. In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard DIS to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard FDIS if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council. 24  The first stepa proposal of work New Proposal is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee e.g.,  SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of Moving Picture Experts Group  ISOIEC JTC1SC29WG11. A working group WG of experts is set up by the TCSC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups e.g.,  MPEG usually make open request for proposalsknown as a call for proposals. The first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model  VM previously also called a simulation and test model. When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft  WD is produced. This is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes committee draft  CD. If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TCSC national bodies for ballot. The CD becomes final committee draft FCD if the number of positive votes is above the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When it is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard DIS. The text is then submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard  FDIS if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TCSC are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed yesno ballot, within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard  IS if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TCSC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO Central Secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard. 22  24  Products named after ISO  edit  The fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous has led, on occasion, to common use of ISO to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are Many CD images end in the file extension  ISO  to signify that they are using the ISO  9660 standard file system as opposed to another file systemhence CD  images are commonly referred to as ISOs. Virtually all computers with CD-ROM drives that can read CDs use this standard. Some DVD-ROMs also use ISO  9660 file systems. Photographic films sensitivity to light its  film speed  is described by ISO  6 , ISO  2240 and ISO  5800 . Hence, the films speed is often referred to by its ISO  number. As it was originally defined in ISO  518, the flash hot shoe found on cameras is often called the ISO  shoe. ISO 11783 , which is marketed as ISOBUS. ISO 13216 , which is marketed as ISOFIX. Criticism  edit  With the exception of a small number of isolated standards, 20  ISO standards are normally not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee, 33  which has been seen by some as too expensive for small open source projects. 34  The ISOIEC JTC1 fast-track procedures Fast-track as used by OOXML and PAS as used by OpenDocument  have garnered criticism in relation to the standardization of Office Open XML ISOIEC  29500. Martin Bryan, outgoing Convenor of ISOIEC JTC1SC34 WG1, is quoted as saying 35  I would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1. The disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting standardization by corporation. The computer security entrepreneur and Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth commented on the Standardization of Office Open XML process by saying I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process, and alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that Microsoft had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML 36  When you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process... ISO is an engineering old boys club and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion  then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results. The process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate lobbying and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear.
