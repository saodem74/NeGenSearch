Aromatic hydrocarbon An aromatic hydrocarbon or arene 32  or sometimes aryl hydrocarbon  33  is a hydrocarbon with sigma bonds and delocalized pi electrons between carbon atoms forming a circle. In contrast, aliphatic hydrocarbons lack this delocalization. The term aromatic was assigned before the physical mechanism determining aromaticity was discovered the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, benzene . Aromatic hydrocarbons can be monocyclic MAH or polycyclic PAH. Arrhenius equation The Arrhenius equation is a formula for the temperature dependence of reaction rates . The equation was proposed by Svante Arrhenius in 1889, based on the work of Dutch chemist Jacobus Henricus van t Hoff who had noted in 1884 that Van t Hoffs equation for the temperature dependence of equilibrium constants suggests such a formula for the rates of both forward and reverse reactions. This equation has a vast and important application in determining rate of chemical reactions and for calculation of energy of activation. Arrhenius provided a physical justification and interpretation for the formula. 34  35  36  Currently, it is best seen as an empirical relationship. 37   188 It can be used to model the temperature variation of diffusion coefficients, population of crystal vacancies, creep rates, and many other thermally-induced processesreactions.

The effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint-brush, in a thin tube, in porous materials such as paper and plaster, in some non-porous materials such as sand and liquefied carbon fiber , or in a cell. It occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces. If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of surface tension which is caused by cohesion within the liquid and adhesive forces between the liquid and container wall act to propel the liquid. 86  Carbonate Any mineral with bound carbon dioxide. Carnot cycle A hypothetical thermodynamic cycle for a heat engine no thermodynamic cycle can be more efficient than a Carnot cycle operating between the same two temperature limits. Cartesian coordinates Coordinates within a rectangular Cartesian plane. Castiglianos method Named for Carlo Alberto Castigliano , is a method for determining the displacements of a linear-elastic system based on the partial derivatives of the energy . He is known for his two theorems. The basic concept may be easy to understand by recalling that a change in energy is equal to the causing force times the resulting displacement. Therefore, the causing force is equal to the change in energy divided by the resulting displacement. Alternatively, the resulting displacement is equal to the change in energy divided by the causing force. Partial derivatives are needed to relate causing forces and resulting displacements to the change in energy. Casting Forming of an object by pouring molten metal or other substances into a mold.

The total force vector acting at the center of pressure is the value of the integrated vectorial pressure field. The resultant force and center of pressure location produce equivalent force and moment on the body as the original pressure field. Central force motion . Central limit theorem In probability theory , the central limit theorem  CLT  establishes that, in some situations, when independent random variables are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a normal distribution informally a  bell curve  even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed.

Charless law Charless law also known as the law of volumes  is an experimental gas law that describes how gases tend to expand when heated . A modern statement of Charless law is When the pressure on a sample of a dry gas is held constant, the Kelvin temperature and the volume will be in direct proportion. 94  Chemical bond Is a lasting attraction between atoms , ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds . The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds . The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably there are strong bonds or primary bonds such as covalent, ionic and metallic bonds, and weak bonds or secondary bonds such as dipoledipole interactions , the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding . Chemical compound Is a chemical substance composed of many identical molecules or molecular entities  composed of atoms from more than one element held together by chemical bonds . A chemical element bonded to an identical chemical element is not a chemical compound since only one element, not two different elements, is involved. Chemical equilibrium In a chemical reaction , chemical equilibrium is the state in which both reactants and products are present in concentrations which have no further tendency to change with time, so that there is no observable change in the properties of the system. 95  Usually, this state results when the forward reaction proceeds at the same rate as the reverse reaction . The reaction rates of the forward and backward reactions are generally not zero, but equal. Thus, there are no net changes in the concentrations of the reactants and products. Such a state is known as dynamic equilibrium . 96  97  Chemical kinetics Chemical kinetics , also known as reaction kinetics , is the study of rates of chemical processes . Chemical kinetics includes investigations of how different experimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield information about the reactions mechanism and transition states , as well as the construction of mathematical models that can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction. Chemical reaction A chemical reaction is a process that leads to the chemical transformation of one set of chemical substances to another. 98  Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms , with no change to the nuclei no change to the elements present, and can often be described by a chemical equation . Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.

Circular motion In physics , circular motion is a movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body. Civil engineering The profession that deals with the design and construction of structures, or other fixed works. ClausiusClapeyron relation The ClausiusClapeyron relation , named after Rudolf Clausius 101  and Benot Paul mile Clapeyron , 102  is a way of characterizing a discontinuous phase transition between two phases of matter of a single constituent. On a pressure  temperature PT diagram, the line separating the two phases is known as the coexistence curve. The ClausiusClapeyron relation gives the slope of the tangents to this curve. Mathematically, d P d T  L T  v   s  v , displaystyle frac mathrm d Pmathrm d Tfrac LT,Delta vfrac Delta sDelta v, where d P  d T displaystyle mathrm d Pmathrm d T is the slope of the tangent to the coexistence curve at any point, L displaystyle L is the specific latent heat , T displaystyle T is the temperature ,  v displaystyle Delta v is the specific volume change of the phase transition, and  s displaystyle Delta s is the specific entropy change of the phase transition. Clausius inequality . Clausius theorem The Clausius theorem 1855 states that a system exchanging heat with external reservoirs and undergoing a cyclic process, is one that ultimately returns a system to its original state,    Q T s u r r  0 , displaystyle oint frac delta QT_surrleq 0, where  Q displaystyle delta Q is the infinitesimal amount of heat absorbed by the system from the reservoir and T s u r r displaystyle T_surr is the temperature of the external reservoir surroundings at a particular instant in time. In the special case of a reversible process, the equality holds. 103  The reversible case is used to introduce the entropy state function. This is because in a cyclic process the variation of a state function is zero. In words, the Clausius statement states that it is impossible to construct a device whose sole effect is the transfer of heat from a cool reservoir to a hot reservoir. 104  Equivalently, heat spontaneously flows from a hot body to a cooler one, not the other way around. 105  The generalized inequality of Clausius 106  d S   Q T s u r r displaystyle dS frac delta QT_surr for an infinitesimal change in entropy S applies not only to cyclic processes, but to any process that occurs in a closed system. Coefficient of performance The coefficient of performance or COP sometimes CP or CoP  of a heat pump, refrigerator or air conditioning system is a ratio of useful heating or cooling provided to work required. 107  108  Higher COPs equate to lower operating costs. The COP usually exceeds 1, especially in heat pumps, because, instead of just converting work to heat which, if 100 efficient, would be a COP_hp of 1, it pumps additional heat from a heat source to where the heat is required. For complete systems, COP calculations should include energy consumption of all power consuming auxili aries. COP is highly dependent on operating conditions, especially absolute temperature and relative temperature between sink and system, and is often graphed or averaged against expected conditions. 109  Coefficient of variation In probability theory and statistics , the coefficient of variation  CV , also known as relative standard deviation  RSD , is a standardized measure of dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution . It is often expressed as a percentage, and is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation    displaystyle  sigma  to the mean    displaystyle  mu  or its absolute value ,    displaystyle mu  . Coherence In physics , two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant phase difference and the same frequency , and the same waveform . Coherence is an ideal property of waves that enables stationary i.e. temporally and spatially constant interference . It contains several distinct concepts, which are limiting cases that never quite occur in reality but allow an understanding of the physics of waves, and has become a very important concept in quantum physics. More generally, coherence describes all properties of the correlation between physical quantities of a single wave, or between several waves or wave packets. Cohesion Or cohesive attraction or cohesive force is the action or property of like molecules sticking together, being mutually attractive . It is an intrinsic property of a substance that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules, which makes the distribution of orbiting electrons irregular when molecules get close to one another, creating electrical attraction that can maintain a microscopic structure such as a water drop . In other words, cohesion allows for surface tension , creating a solid-like state upon which light-weight or low-density materials can be placed. Cold forming Or cold working , any metal-working procedure such as hammering, rolling, shearing, bending, milling, etc. carried out below the metals recrystallization temperature.

The design of an invention can itself also be to compensate for some other existing issue or exception . Compiler A computer program that translates a high-level language into machine language. Compressive strength Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size, as opposed to tensile strength , which withstands loads tending to elongate. In other words, compressive strength resists compression being pushed together, whereas tensile strength resists tension being pulled apart. In the study of strength of materials , tensile strength, compressive strength, and shear strength can be analyzed independently.

The term CADD for Computer Aided Design and Drafting  is also used. 113  Computer-aided engineering Computer-aided engineering  CAE  is the broad usage of computer software to aid in engineering analysis tasks. It includes finite element analysis FEA , computational fluid dynamics CFD , multibody dynamics MBD , durability and optimization . Computer-aided manufacturing Computer-aided manufacturing  CAM  is the use of software to control machine tools and related ones in the manufacturing of workpieces. 114  115  116  117  118  This is not the only definition for CAM, but it is the most common 114  CAM may also refer to the use of a computer to assist in all operations of a manufacturing plant, including planning, management, transportation and storage. 119  120  Computer engineering Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of computer science and electronics engineering required to develop computer hardware and software . 121  Computer science Is the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers .

A lens with two concave surfaces is biconcave or just concave . If one of the surfaces is flat, the lens is plano-convex or plano-concave depending on the curvature of the other surface. A lens with one convex and one concave side is convex-concave or meniscus . Condensed matter physics Is the field of physics that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of matter. In particular it is concerned with the condensed phases that appear whenever the number of constituents in a system is extremely large and the interactions between the constituents are strong. Confidence interval In statistics , a confidence interval or compatibility interval  CI  is a type of interval estimate , computed from the statistics of the observed data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter . The interval has an associated confidence level that, loosely speaking, quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies in the interval. More strictly speaking, the confidence level represents the frequency i.e. the proportion of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level from an infinite number of independent sample statistics, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will be eq ual to the confidence level. 123  124  125  Conjugate acid A conjugate acid , within the BrnstedLowry acidbase theory , is a species formed by the reception of a proton  H   by a base in other words, it is a base with a hydrogen ion added to it. On the other hand, a conjugate base is what is left over after an acid has donated a proton during a chemical reaction. Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an acid. 126  Because some acids are capable of releasing multiple protons, the conjugate base of an acid may itself be acidic.

Hence, a conjugate base is a species formed by the removal of a proton from an acid. 126  Because some acids are capable of releasing multiple protons, the conjugate base of an acid may itself be acidic.. Conservation of energy In physics and chemistry, the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant it is said to be conserved over time. 127  This law means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. Conservation of mass The law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy , the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as systems mass cannot change, so quantity cannot be added nor removed. Hence, the quantity of mass is conserved over time. Continuity equation A continuity equation in physics is an equation that describes the transport of some quantity. It is particularly simple and powerful when applied to a conserved quantity , but it can be generalized to apply to any extensive quantity . Since mass , energy , momentum , electric charge and other natural  quantities are conserved under their respective appropriate conditions, a variety of physical phenomena may be described using continuity equations. Continuum mechanics Is a branch of mechanics that deals with the mechanical behavior of materials modeled as a continuous mass rather than as discrete particles. The French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy was the first to formulate such models in the 19th century. Control engineering Control engineering or control systems engineering is an engineering discipline that applies automatic control theory to design systems with desired behaviors in control environments. 128  The discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with electrical engineering at many institutions around the world. 128  . Convex lens Lenses are classified by the curvature of the two optical surfaces. A lens is biconvex or double convex , or just convex  if both surfaces are convex . If both surfaces have the same radius of curvature, the lens is equiconvex . A lens with two concave surfaces is biconcave or just concave . If one of the surfaces is flat, the lens is plano-convex or plano-concave depending on the curvature of the other surface. A lens with one convex and one concave side is convex-concave or meniscus . Corrosion Is a natural process , which converts a refined metal to a more chemically-stable form, such as its oxide , hydroxide , or sulfide .

Corrosion engineering is the field dedicated to controlling and stopping corrosion. Cosmic rays Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation , mainly originating outside the Solar System . 129  Coulomb The coulomb symbol C is the International System of Units SI unit of electric charge . It is the charge symbol Q or q  transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second  1   C  1   A  1   s displaystyle 1textC1textAcdot 1texts Thus, it is also the amount of excess charge on a capacitor of one farad charged to a potential difference of one volt  1   C  1   F  1   V displaystyle 1textC1textFcdot 1textV The coulomb is equivalent to the charge of approximately 6.242  10 18  1.036  10 5 mol  protons , and 1  C is equivalent to the charge of approximately 6.242  10 18 electrons . A new definition , in terms of the elementary charge , will take effect on 20 May 2019. 130  The new definition, defines the elementary charge the charge of the proton as exactly 1.602 176 634  10 19 coulombs. This would implicitly define the coulomb as  1  0.160 217 6634  10 18 elementary charges. Coulombs law Coulombs law , or Coulombs inverse-square law , is a law of physics for quantifying Coulombs force, or electrostatic force. Electrostatic force is the amount of force with which stationary, electrically charged particles either repel, or attract each other. This force and the law for quantifying it, represent one of the most basic forms of force used in the physical sciences, and were an essential basis to the study and development of the theory and field of classical electromagnetism . The law was first published in 1785 by French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb . 131  In its scalar form, the law is F  k e q 1 q 2 r 2 displaystyle Fk_efrac q_1q_2r2 , where k e is Coulombs constant  k e  9  10 9  N m 2 C 2 , q 1 and q 2 are the signed magnitudes of the charges, and the scalar r is the distance between the charges. The force of the interaction between the charges is attractive if the charges have opposite signs i.e., F is negative and repulsive if like-signed i.e., F is positive. Being an inverse-square law , the law is analogous to Isaac Newton s inverse-square law of universal gravitation . Coulombs law can be used to derive Gausss law , and vice versa. Covalent bond A covalent bond , also called a molecular bond , is a chemical bond that involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms . Crookes tube A type of vacuum tube that demonstrates cathode rays. Cryogenics The science of low temperatures.

Deformation engineering In materials science , deformation refers to any changes in the shape or size of an object due to an applied force the deformation energy in this case is transferred through work or a change in temperature the deformation energy in this case is transferred through heat. The first case can be a result of tensile pulling forces, compressive pushing forces, shear , bending or torsion twisting. In the second case, the most significant factor, which is determined by the temperature, is the mobility of the structural defects such as grain boundaries, point vacancies, line and screw dislocations, stacking faults and twins in both crystalline and non-crystalline solids. The movement or displacement of such mobile defects is thermally activated, and thus limi ted by the rate of atomic diffusion. 140  141  Deformation mechanics Deformation in continuum mechanics is the transformation of a body from a reference configuration to a current configuration. 142  A configuration is a set containing the positions of all particles of the body.

Density The density , or more precisely, the volumetric mass density , of a substance is its mass per unit volume . The symbol most often used for density is  the lower case Greek letter rho , although the Latin letter D can also be used. Mathematically, density is defined as mass divided by volume 144    m V displaystyle rho frac mV where  is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume. In some cases for instance, in the United States oil and gas industry, density is loosely defined as its weight per unit volume , 145  although this is scientifically inaccurate  this quantity is more specifically called specific weight . Derivative The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value output value with respect to a change in its argument input value. Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus . For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the objects velocity  this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances. Design engineering . Dew point The pressure and temperature at which air is holding the maximum possible humidity. Diamagnetism Diamagnetic materials are repelled by a magnetic field  an applied magnetic field creates an induced magnetic field in them in the opposite direction, causing a repulsive force. In contrast, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials are attracted by a magnetic field. Diamagnetism is a quantum mechanical effect that occurs in all materials when it is the only contribution to the magnetism, the material is called diamagnetic. In paramagnetic and ferromagnetic substances the weak diamagnetic force is overcome by the attractive force of magnetic dipoles in the material. The magnetic permeability of diamagnetic materials is less than  0 , the permeability of vacuum. In most materials diamagnetism is a weak effect which can only be detected by sensitive laboratory instruments, but a superconductor acts as a strong diamagnet because it repels a magnetic field entirely from its interior. Dielectric An insulator, a material that does not permit free flow of electricity. Differential pressure . Differential pulley A differential pulley , also called Weston differential pulley , or colloquially chain fall , is used to manually lift very heavy objects like car engines . It is operated by pulling upon the slack section of a continuous chain that wraps around pulleys. The relative size of two connected pulleys determines the maximum weight that can be lifted by hand. The load will remain in place and not lower under the force of gravity  until the chain is pulled. 146  Differential signaling Is a method for electrically transmitting information using two complementary signals . Diffusion Is the net movement of molecules or atoms from a region of higher concentration or high chemical potential to a region of lower concentration or low chemical potential. Dimensional analysis is the analysis of the relationships between different physical quantities by identifying their base quantities such as length , mass , time , and electric charge  and units of measure such as miles vs. kilometers, or pounds vs. kilograms and tracking these dimensions as calculations or comparisons are performed. The conversion of units from one dimensional unit to another is often somewhat complex. Dimensional analysis, or more specifically the factor-label method , also known as the unit-factor method , is a widely used technique for such conversions using the rules of algebra . 147  148  149  Direct integration of a beam Direct integration is a structural analysis method for measuring internal shear, internal moment, rotation, and deflection of a beam. For a beam with an applied weight w  x  displaystyle wx , taking downward to be positive, the internal shear force is given by taking the negative integral of the weight V  x     w  x  d x displaystyle Vx-int wx,dx The internal moment Mx is the integral of the internal shear M  x    V  x  d x displaystyle Mxint Vx,dx      w  x    d x  d x displaystyle -int int wx ,dxdx The angle of rotation from the horizontal,  displaystyle theta  , is the integral of the internal moment divided by the product of the Youngs modulus and the area moment of inertia    x   1 E I  M  x  d x displaystyle theta xfrac 1EIint Mx,dx Integrating the angle of rotation obtains the vertical displacement  displaystyle nu     x      x  d x displaystyle nu xint theta xdx . Dispersion In optics , dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency. 150  Media having this common property may be termed dispersive media . Sometimes the term chromatic dispersion is used for specificity. Although the term is used in the field of optics to describe light and other electromagnetic waves , dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as acoustic dispersion in the case of sound and seismic waves, in gravity waves ocean waves, and for telecommunication signals along transmission lines such as coaxial cable  or optical fiber . Displacement fluid In fluid mechanics , displacement occurs when an object is immersed in a fluid , pushing it out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced can then be measured, and from this, the volume of the immersed object can be deduced the volume of the immersed object will be exactly equal to the volume of the displaced fluid. Displacement vector Is a vector whose length is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point P. 151  It quantifies both the distance and direction of an imaginary motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point. A displacement may be identified with the translation that maps the initial position to the final position. Distance is a numerical measurement of how far apart objects are. Doppler effect The Doppler effect or the Doppler shift  is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. 152  It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler , who described the phenomenon in 1842. Doseresponse relationship . Drag In fluid dynamics , drag sometimes called air resistance , a type of friction , or fluid resistance , another type of friction or fluid friction is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid. 153  This can exist between two fluid layers or surfaces or a fluid and a solid surface. Unlike other resistive forces, such as dry friction , which are nearly independent of velocity, drag forces depend on velocity. 154  155  Drag force is proportional to the velocity for a laminar flow and the squared velocity for a turbulent flow . Even though the ultimate cause of a drag is viscous friction, the turbulent drag is independent of viscosity . 156  Drag forces always decrease fluid velocity relative to the solid object in the fluids path . Drift current In condensed matter physics and electrochemistry , drift current is the electric current , or movement of charge carriers , which is due to the applied electric field , often stated as the electromotive force over a given distance. When an electric field is applied across a semiconductor material, a current is produced due to the flow of charge carriers.

Elasticity In physics , elasticity is the ability of a body to resist a distorting influence and to return to its original size and shape when that influence or force is removed. Solid objects will deform when adequate forces are applied to them. If the material is elastic, the object will return to its initial shape and size when these forces are removed. Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field . There are two types of electric charges positive and negative commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively. Like charges repel and unlike attract. An object with an absence of net charge is referred to as neutral .

Electric current is measured using a device called an ammeter . 160  Electric displacement field In physics , the electric displacement field , denoted by D , is a vector field that appears in Maxwells equations . It accounts for the effects of free and bound charge within materials.  D  stands for displacement, as in the related concept of displacement current in dielectrics . In free space , the electric displacement field is equivalent to flux density , a concept that lends understanding to Gausss law . In the International System of Units SI, it is expressed in units of coulomb per meter squared C m 2 .

Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motors magnetic field and winding currents to generate force in the form of rotation . Electric motors can be powered by direct current DC sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current AC sources, such as a power grid, inverters or electrical generators. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates in the reverse direction, accepting mechanical energy such as from flowing water and converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy. Electric potential Also called the electric field potential , potential drop or the electrostatic potential  is the amount of work needed to move a unit of positive charge from a reference point to a specific point inside the field without producing an acceleration. Typically, the reference point is the Earth or a point at infinity , although any point beyond the influence of the electric field charge can be used. Electrical potential energy Electric potential energy, or electrostatic potential energy, is a potential energy measured in joules  that results from conservative Coulomb forces and is associated with the configuration of a particular set of point charges within a defined system . An object may have electric potential energy by virtue of two key elements its own electric charge and its relative position to other electrically charged objects .

It emerged as an identified activity in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph , the telephone , and electrical power generation, distribution and use. . Electrical conductance The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current. The inverse quantity is electrical conductance , and is the ease with which an electric current passes. Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with the notion of mechanical friction . The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm   , while electrical conductance is measured in siemens S. Electrical conductor Is an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge  electrical current  in one or more directions. Materials made of metal are common electrical conductors. Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases. Electrical impedance Is the measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied. The term complex impedance may be used interchangeably. Electrical insulator Is a material whose internal electric charges do not flow freely very little electric current will flow through it under the influence of an electric field . This contrasts with other materials, semiconductors and conductors , which conduct electric current more easily. The property that distinguishes an insulator is its resistivity  insulators have higher resistivity than semiconductors or conductors. Electrical network . Electrical resistance . Electricity .

Falling bodies . Farad The SI unit of capacitance. Faraday . Faraday constant Denoted by the symbol F and sometimes stylized as , is named after Michael Faraday . In physics and chemistry , this constant represents the magnitude of electric charge per mole of electrons . 163  It has the value 96 485 .332 12 ...  C mol 1 . 164  This constant has a simple relation to two other physical constants F  e N A displaystyle F,,eN_A where e      1.602 176 634  10 19  C  165  N A      6.022 140 76  10 23  mol 1 . 166  Both of these values have exact defined values, and hence F has a known exact value. N A is the Avogadro constant the ratio of the number of particles, N , which is unitless, to the amount of substance, n , in units of moles, and e is the elementary charge or the magnitude of the charge of an electron. This relation holds because the amount of charge of a mole of electrons is equal to the amount of charge in one electron multiplied by the number of electrons in a mole. Fermats principle In optics , Fermats principle or the principle of least time , named after French mathematician Pierre de Fermat , is the principle that the path taken between two points by a ray of light is the path that can be traversed in the least time. This principle is sometimes taken as the definition of a ray of light. 167  However, this version of the principle is not general a more modern statement of the principle is that rays of light traverse the path of stationary optical length with respect to variations of the path. 168  In other words, a ray of light prefers the path such that there are other paths, arbitrarily nearby on either side, along which the ray would take almost exactly the same time to traverse.

The Kalman filter has numerous applications in technology.

In other words, tensile strength resists tension being pulled apart, whereas compressive strength resists compression being pushed together. Ultimate tensile strength is measured by the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking. In the study of strength of materials , tensile strength, compressive strength, and shear strength can be analyzed independently. Uncertainty principle In quantum mechanics , the uncertainty principle also known as Heisenbergs uncertainty principle  is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities 182  asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle , known as complementary variables , such as position x and momentum p , can be known.

Volt-ampere reactive . Volta potential The Volta potential also called Volta potential difference , contact potential difference , outer potential difference , , or delta psi in electrochemistry , is the electrostatic potential difference between two metals or one metal and one electrolyte  that are in contact and are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically, it is the potential difference between a point close to the surface of the first metal, and a point close to the surface of the second metal or electrolyte . 186  Voltage Voltage , electric potential difference , electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points. The difference in electric potential between two points i.e., voltage is defined as the work needed per unit of charge against a static electric field to move a test charge between the two points. In the International System of Units , the derived unit for voltage is named volt . 187  In SI units, work per unit charge is expressed as joules per coulomb, where 1 volt  1 joule of work per 1 coulomb of charge. The official SI definition for volt uses power and current, where 1 volt  1 watt of power per 1 ampere of current. 187  Volumetric flow rate Also known as volume flow rate , rate of fluid flow or volume velocity , is the volume of fluid which passes per unit time usually represented by the symbol Q sometimes V . The SI unit is m 3 s  cubic metres per second . von Mises yield criterion The von Mises yield criterion also known as the maximum distortion energy criterion 188   suggests that yielding of a ductile material begins when the second deviatoric stress invariant J 2 displaystyle J_2 reaches a critical value. 189  It is part of plasticity theory that applies best to ductile materials, such as some metals. Prior to yield, material response can be assumed to be of a nonlinear elastic, viscoelastic, or linear elastic behavior. In materials science and engineering the von Mises yield criterion can also be formulated in terms of the von Mises stress or equivalent tensile stress ,  v displaystyle sigma _v . This is a scalar value of stress that can be computed from the Cauchy stress tensor . In this case, a material is said to start yielding when the von Mises stress reaches a value known as yield strength ,  y displaystyle sigma _y . The von Mises stress is used to predict yielding of materials under complex loading from the results of uniaxial tensile tests. The von Mises stress satisfies the property where two stress states with equal distortion energy have an equal von Mises stress.

Wave Is a disturbance that transfers energy through matter or space, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist of oscillations or vibrations of a physical medium or a field , around relatively fixed locations. From the perspective of mathematics, waves, as functions of time and space, are a class of signals . 190  Wavelength Is the spatial period of a periodic wavethe distance over which the waves shape repeats. 191  192  It is thus the inverse of the spatial frequency . Wavelength is usually determined by considering the distance between consecutive corresponding points of the same phase , such as crests, troughs, or zero crossings and is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves , as well as other spatial wave patterns. 193  194  Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda . The term wavelength is also sometimes applied to modulated waves, and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids. 195   . Wedge Is a triangular shaped tool, and is a portable inclined plane , and one of the six classical simple machines . It can be used to separate two objects or portions of an object, lift up an object, or hold an object in place. It functions by converting a force applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular  normal  to its inclined surfaces. The mechanical advantage of a wedge is given by the ratio of the length of its slope to its width. 196  197  Although a short wedge with a wide angle may do a job faster, it requires more force than a long wedge with a narrow angle. Weighted arithmetic mean The weighted arithmetic mean is similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean the most common type of average , except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points contribute more than others. The notion of weighted mean plays a role in descriptive statistics and also occurs in a more general form in several other areas of mathematics. If all the weights are equal, then the weighted mean is the same as the arithmetic mean . While weighted means generally behave in a similar fashion to arithmetic means, they do have a few counterintuitive properties, as captured for instance in Simpsons paradox . Wet-bulb temperature The temperature of a wetted thermometer with an air current across it. Used in psychrometry. . Wheel and axle Are one of six simple machines identified by Renaissance scientists drawing from Greek texts on technology. 198  The wheel and axle consists of a wheel attached to a smaller axle so that these two parts rotate together in which a force is transferred from one to the other. A hinge or bearing supports the axle, allowing rotation. It can amplify force a small force applied to the periphery of the large wheel can move a larger load attached to the axle. Winsorized mean Is a winsorized statistical measure of central tendency , much like the mean and median , and even more similar to the truncated mean . It involves the calculation of the mean after replacing given parts of a probability distribution or sample at the high and low end with the most extreme remaining values, 199  typically doing so for an equal amount of both extremes often 10 to 25 percent of the ends are replaced. The winsorized mean can equivalently be expressed as a weighted average of the truncated mean and the quantiles at which it is limited, which corresponds to replacing parts with the corresponding quantiles. Work hardening Also known as strain hardening , is the strengthening of a metal or polymer by plastic deformation . This strengthening occurs because of dislocation movements and dislocation generation within the crystal structure of the material. 200  X  edit  X-coordinate . Y  edit  Y-coordinate . Yield The point of maximum elastic deformation of a material above yield the material is permanently deformed. Youngs modulus A measure of the stiffness of a material the amount of force per unit area require to produce a unit strain. Z  edit  Zero defects A quality assurance philosophy that aims to reduce the need for inspection of components by improving their quality. Zero force member In the field of engineering mechanics , a zero force member is a member a single truss segment in a truss which, given a specific load , is at rest neither in tension , nor in compression . In a truss a zero force member is often found at pins any connections within the truss where no external load is applied and three or fewer truss members meet. Recognizing basic zero force members can be accomplished by analyzing the forces acting on an individual pin in a physical system . NOTE If the pin has an external force or moment applied to it, then all of the members attached to that pin are not zero force members UNLESS the external force acts in a manner that fulfills one of the rules below If two non-collinear members meet in an unloaded joint , both are zero-force members. If three members meet in an unloaded joint of which two are collinear, then the third member is a zero-force member. Reasons for Zero-force members in a truss system These members contribute to the stability of the structure, by providing buckling prevention for long slender members under compressive forces These members can carry loads in the event that variations are introduced in the normal external loading configuration. Zeroth law of thermodynamics The equivalence principle applied to temperature two systems in thermal equiplbirum with a third are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
