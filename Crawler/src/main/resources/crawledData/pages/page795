Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare FRS FREng 3  born 11 January 1934, 4  is a British computer scientist . He developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 19591960. 5  He also developed Hoare logic for verifying program correctness, and the formal language communicating sequential processes CSP to specify the interactions of concurrent processes including the dining philosophers problem  and the inspiration for the occam programming language . 6  7  8  9  10  11  Contents 1 Education and early life 2 Research and career 2.1 Apologies and retractions 2.2 Books 3 Personal 3.1 Awards and honours 4 References Education and early life  edit  Born in Colombo , Ceylon now Sri Lanka  to British parents, Tony Hoares father was a colonial civil servant and his mother was the daughter of a tea planter. Hoare was educated in England at the Dragon School in Oxford and the Kings School in Canterbury . 12  He then studied Classics and Philosophy Greats at Merton College, Oxford . 13  On graduating in 1956 he did 18 months National Service in the Royal Navy , 13  where he learned Russian. 14  He returned to the University of Oxford in 1958 to study for a postgraduate certificate in Statistics, 13  and it was here that he began computer programming, having been taught Autocode on the Ferranti Mercury by Leslie Fox . 15  He then went to Moscow State University as a British Council exchange student, 13  where he studied machine translation under Andrey Kolmogorov . 14  Research and career  edit  In 1960, Hoare left the Soviet Union and began working at Elliott Brothers Ltd , 13  a small computer manufacturing firm located in London, where he implemented ALGOL 60 and began developing major algorithms . 16  17  He became the Professor of Computing Science at the Queens University of Belfast in 1968, and in 1977 returned to Oxford as the Professor of Computing to lead the Programming Research Group in the Oxford University Computing Laboratory now Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford , following the death of Christopher Strachey . He is now an Emeritus Professor there, and is also a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge , England. 18  19  20  Hoares most significant work has been in the following areas his sorting and selection algorithm  Quicksort and Quickselect , Hoare logic , the formal language Communicating Sequential Processes CSP used to specify the interactions between concurrent processes , structuring computer operating systems using the monitor concept, and the axiomatic specification of programming languages . 21  22  Apologies and retractions  edit  Speaking at a software conference called QCon London in 2009, he apologised for inventing the null reference  23  .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965. At that time, I was designing the first comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language  ALGOL W . My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe, with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldnt resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years. For many years under his leadership, his Oxford department worked on formal specification languages such as CSP and Z . These did not achieve the expected take-up by industry, and in 1995 Hoare was led to reflect upon the original assumptions 24  Ten years ago, researchers into formal methods and I was the most mistaken among them predicted that the programming world would embrace with gratitude every assistance promised by formalisation to solve the problems of reliability that arise when programs get large and more safety-critical. Programs have now got very large and very critical  well beyond the scale which can be comfortably tackled by formal methods. There have been many problems and failures, but these have nearly always been attributable to inadequate analysis of requirements or inadequate management control. It has turned out that the world just does not suffer significantly from the kind of problem that our research was originally intended to solve. Books  edit  O.-J. Dahl , E. W. Dijkstra and C. A. R.
