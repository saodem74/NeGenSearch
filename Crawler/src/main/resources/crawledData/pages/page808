Its variants seat 242 to 330 passengers in typical two-class seating configurations. It is the first airliner with an airframe constructed primarily of composite materials . The 787 was designed to be 20 more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 767 , which it was intended to replace. The 787 Dreamliners distinguishing features include mostly electrical flight systems, raked wingtips , and noise-reducing chevrons on its engine nacelles . The aircrafts initial designation was the 7E7 , prior to its renaming in January 2005. The first 787 was unveiled in a roll-out ceremony on July 8, 2007, at Boeings Everett factory. Development and production of the 787 has involved a large-scale collaboration with numerous suppliers worldwide. Final assembly takes place at the Boeing Everett Factory in Everett, Washington , and at the Boeing South Carolina factory in North Charleston, South Carolina . Originally planned to enter service in May 2008, the project experienced multiple delays. The airliners maiden flight took place on December 15, 2009, and flight testing was completed in mid-2011. Boeing has reportedly spent 32 billion on the 787 program. Final US Federal Aviation Administration FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency EASA type certification was received in August 2011 and the first 787-8 was delivered in September 2011. It entered commercial service on October 26, 2011, with launch customer All Nippon Airways . The stretched 787-9 variant, which is 20 feet 6.1  m longer and can fly 450 nautical miles 830  km farther than the -8, first flew in September 2013. Deliveries of the 787-9 began in July 2014 it entered commercial service on August 7, 2014, with All Nippon Airways, with 787-9 launch customer Air New Zealand following two days later. As of June  2019 update  , the 787 had orders for 1,441 aircraft from 72 identified customers. 1  The aircraft has suffered from several in-service problems related to its lithium-ion batteries , including fires on board during commercial service. These systems were reviewed by both the FAA and the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau . The FAA issued a directive in January 2013 that grounded all 787s in the US and other civil aviation authorities followed suit. After Boeing completed tests on a revised battery design, the FAA approved the revised design and lifted the grounding in April 2013 the 787 returned to passenger service later that month.

Two new aircraft were proposed. The 747X would have lengthened the 747-400 and improved efficiency, and the Sonic Cruiser would have achieved 15 higher speeds approximately Mach 0.98 while burning fuel at the same rate as the 767. 4  Market interest for the 747X was tepid however, several major American airlines, including Continental Airlines , showed initial enthusiasm for the Sonic Cruiser, although concerns about the operating cost were also expressed. 5  The global airline market was disrupted by the September 11, 2001, attacks and increased petroleum prices, making airlines more interested in efficiency than speed. The worst-affected airlines, those in the United States, had been considered the most likely customers of the Sonic Cruiser thus the Sonic Cruiser was officially cancelled on December 20, 2002. On January 29, 2003 Boeing announced an alternative product, the 7E7, using Sonic Cruiser technology in a more conventional configuration. 6  7  The emphasis on a smaller midsize twinjet rather than a large 747-size aircraft represented a shift from hub-and-spoke theory toward the point-to-point theory , 8  in response to analysis of focus groups . 9  Randy Baseler, Boeing Commercial Airplanes VP Marketing stated that airport congestion comes from a large numbers of regional jets and small single-aisles , flying to destinations where a 550-seat A380 would be too large to reduce the number of departures, smaller airplanes can increase 20 in size and airline hubs can be avoided with point-to-point transit . 10  The Dreamliner name was announced in July 2003. This logo is painted on many 787s. The replacement for the Sonic Cruiser project was named 7E7 11  with a development code name of Y2. Technology from the Sonic Cruiser and 7E7 was to be used as part of Boeings project to replace its entire airliner product line, an endeavor called the Yellowstone Project of which the 7E7 became the first stage. 12  Early concept images of the 7E7 included rakish cockpit windows, a dropped nose and a distinctive shark-fin tail . 13  The E was said to stand for various things, such as efficiency or environmentally friendly however, in the end, Boeing said that it merely stood for Eight. 6  In July 2003, a public naming competition was held for the 7E7, for which out of 500,000 votes cast online the winning title was Dreamliner . 14  Other names included eLiner , Global Cruiser , and Stratoclimber . 15  16  All Nippon Airways launched the 787 program with an order for 50 aircraft in 2004. On April 26, 2004, Japanese airline All Nippon Airways ANA became the launch customer for the 787, announcing a firm order for 50 aircraft with deliveries to begin in late 2008. 17  The ANA order was initially specified as 30 787-3, 290330 seat, one-class domestic aircraft, and 20 787-8, long-haul, 210250 seat, two-class aircraft for regional international routes such as Tokyo Narita Beijing, and could perform routes to cities not previously served, such as Denver , Moscow , and New Delhi . 18  The 787-3 and 787-8 were to be the initial variants, with the 787-9 entering service in 2010. 19  The 787 was designed to be the first production airliner with the fuselage comprising one-piece composite barrel sections instead of the multiple aluminum sheets and some 50,000 fasteners used on existing aircraft. 20  21  Boeing selected two new engines to power the 787, the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 and General Electric GEnx . 6  Boeing stated the 787 would be approximately 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the 767, 22  with approximately 40 percent of the efficiency gain from the engines, 23  plus gains from aerodynamic improvements, 24  increased use of lighter-weight composite materials, and advanced systems. 19  The airframe underwent extensive structural testing during its design. 25  26  The 787-8 and -9 were intended to have a certified 330 minute ETOPS capability. 27  During the design phase, the 787 underwent extensive wind tunnel testing at Boeings Transonic Wind Tunnel, QinetiQ s five-meter wind tunnel at Farnborough , United Kingdom, and NASA Ames Research Center s wind tunnel, as well as at the French aerodynamics research agency, ONERA . The final styling was more conservative than earlier proposals, with the fin, nose, and cockpit windows changed to a more conventional form. By 2005, customer-announced orders and commitments for the 787 reached 237 aircraft. 28  Boeing initially priced the 787-8 variant at US120  million, a low figure that surprised the industry. In 2007, the list price was US146151.5  million for the 787-3, US157167  million for the 787-8 and US189200  million for the 787-9. 29  Manufacturing and suppliers  edit  On December 16, 2003, Boeing announced that the 787 would be assembled in its factory in Everett, Washington . 6  Instead of conventionally building the aircraft from the ground up, final assembly employed 800 to 1,200 people to join completed subassemblies and to integrate systems. 30  Boeing assigned global subcontractors to do more assembly work, delivering completed subassemblies to Boeing for final assembly. This approach was intended to result in a leaner, simpler assembly line and lower inventory, 31  with pre-installed systems reducing final assembly time by three-quarters to three days. 32  33  Subcontractors had early difficulties procuring needed parts and finishing subassemblies on schedule, leaving remaining assembly work for Boeing to complete as traveled work. 34  35  In 2010, Boeing considered in-house construction of the 787-9 tail the tail of the 787-8 is made by Alenia. 36  The 787 was unprofitable for some subcontractors Alenias parent company, Finmeccanica, had a total loss of 750 million on the project by 2013. 37  Assembly of Section 41, the nose section of the Boeing 787 Subcontracted assemblies included wing and center wing box  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries , Japan Subaru Corporation , Japan 38  horizontal stabilizers  Alenia Aeronautica , Italy Korea Aerospace Industries , South Korea 39  fuselage sections Global Aeronautica, Italy Boeing, North Charleston , US Kawasaki Heavy Industries , Japan Spirit AeroSystems , Wichita , US Korean Air , South Korea 40  41  42  passenger doors  Latcore , France cargo doors, access doors, and crew escape door  Saab AB , Sweden software development  HCL Enterprise India 43  floor beams  TAL Manufacturing Solutions Limited , India 44  45  wiring  Labinal , France 46  wing-tips, flap support fairings, wheel well bulkhead, and longerons Korean Air, South Korea 47  landing gear  Messier-Bugatti-Dowty , UKFrance 48  49  and power distribution and management systems, air conditioning packs  Hamilton Sundstrand , Connecticut , US. 46  50  To speed up deliveries, Boeing modified four used 747-400s into 747 Dreamlifters to transport 787 wings, fuselage sections, and other smaller parts. Japanese industrial participation was key on the project. Japanese companies co-designed and built 35 of the aircraft the first time that outside firms played a key design role on Boeing airliner wings. The Japanese government supported development with an estimated US2 billion in loans. 51  On April 26, 2006, Japanese manufacturer Toray Industries and Boeing signed a production agreement involving US6  billion worth of carbon fiber , extending a 2004 contract. 6  In May 2007, final assembly on the first 787 began at Everett. 52  Boeing worked to trim excess weight since assembly of the first airframe began in late 2006, the first six 787s were stated to be overweight, with the first aircraft being 5,000  lb 2,300  kg heavier than specified. 53  The seventh and subsequent aircraft would be the first optimized 787-8s expected to meet all goals. 54  55  Accordingly, some parts were redesigned to include more use of titanium . 56  57  Early built 787s were overweight and some carriers decided to take later aircraft in early 2015, Boeing was trying to sell 10 such aircraft. 58  In July 2015, Reuters reported that Boeing was considering reducing the use of titanium to reduce construction costs. 59  The first public appearance of the 787 on July 8, 2007 Boeing planned a first flight by the end of August 2007 and premiered the first 787  registered N787BA at a rollout ceremony on July 8, 2007. 60  The 787 had 677 orders at this time, which is more orders from launch to roll-out than any previous wide-body airliner. 61  The major systems were not installed at the time many parts were attached with temporary non-aerospace fasteners requiring replacement with flight fasteners later. 62  In September 2007, Boeing announced a three-month delay, blaming a shortage of fasteners as well as incomplete software. 63  On October 10, 2007, a second three-month delay to the first flight and a six-month delay to first deliveries was announced due to supply chain problems, a lack of documentation from overseas suppliers, and flight guidance software delays. 64  65  Less than a week later, Mike Bair, the 787 program manager was replaced. 66  On January 16, 2008, Boeing announced a third three-month delay to the first flight of the 787, citing insufficient progress on traveled work. 67  On March 28, 2008, in an effort to gain more control over the supply chain, Boeing announced plans to buy Vought Aircraft Industries interest in Global Aeronautica a later agreement was also made to buy Voughts factory in North Charleston. 68  On April 9, 2008, a fourth delay was announced, shifting the maiden flight to the fourth quarter of 2008, and delaying initial deliveries by around 15 months to the third quarter of 2009. The 787-9 variant was postponed to 2012 and the 787-3 variant was to follow at a later date. 69  On November 4, 2008, a fifth delay was announced due to incorrect fastener installation and the Boeing machinists strike , stating that the first test flight would not occur in the fourth quarter of 2008. 70  71  After assessing the program schedule with suppliers, 72  in December 2008, Boeing stated that the first flight was delayed until the second quarter of 2009. 73  Airlines, such as United Airlines and Air India , stated their intentions to seek compensation from Boeing for the delays. 74  75  Pre-flight ground testing  edit  As Boeing worked with its suppliers towards production, the design proceeded through a series of test goals. On August 23, 2007, a crash test involving a vertical drop of a partial composite fuselage section from about 15  ft 4.6  m onto a 1  in 25  mm-thick steel plate occurred in Mesa, Arizona  76  77  the results matched predictions, allowing modeling of various crash scenarios using computational analysis instead of further physical tests. 78  79  While critics had expressed concerns that a composite fuselage could shatter and burn with toxic fumes during crash landings, test data indicated no greater toxicity than conventional metal airframes. 80  81  The crash test was the third in a series of demonstrations conducted to match FAA requirements, including additional certification criteria due to the wide-scale use of composite materials. 77  The 787 meets the FAAs requirement that passengers have at least as good a chance of surviving a crash landing as they would with current metal airliners. 82  The prototype Boeing 787 underwent taxi tests at Paine Field in November and December 2009. On August 7, 2007, on-time certification of the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine by European and US regulators was received. 83  The alternative GE GEnx-1B engine achieved certification on March 31, 2008. 84  On June 20, 2008, the first aircraft was powered up, for testing the electrical supply and distribution systems. 85  A non-flightworthy static test airframe was built on September 27, 2008, the fuselage was successfully tested at 14.9 psi 102.7 kPa differential, which is 150 percent of the maximum pressure expected in commercial service. 86  In December 2008, the 787s maintenance program was passed by the FAA. 87  On May 3, 2009, the first test 787 was moved to the flight line following extensive factory-testing, including landing gear swings, systems integration verification, and a total run-through of the first flight. 88  On May 4, 2009, a press report indicated a 1015 range reduction, about 6,900  nmi 12,800  km instead of the originally promised 7,700 to 8,200 nmi 14,80015,700  km, for early aircraft that were about 8 overweight. Substantial redesign work was expected to correct this, which would complicate increases in production rates 89  Boeing stated the early 787-8s would have a range of almost 8,000  nmi 15,000  km. 90  As a result, some airlines reportedly delayed deliveries of 787s in order to take later planes that may be closer to the original estimates. 91  Boeing expected to have the weight issues addressed by the 21st production model. 92  On June 15, 2009, during the Paris Air Show , Boeing said that the 787 would make its first flight within two weeks. However, on June 23, 2009, the first flight was postponed due to structural reasons. 93  94  Boeing provided an updated 787 schedule on August 27, 2009, with the first flight planned to occur by the end of 2009 and deliveries to begin at the end of 2010. 95  The company expected to write off US2.5  billion because it considered the first three Dreamliners built unsellable and suitable only for flight tests. 96  On October 28, 2009, Boeing selected Charleston, SC as the site for a second 787 production line, after soliciting bids from multiple states. 97  On December 12, 2009, the first 787 completed high speed taxi tests, the last major step before flight. 98  99  Flight test program  edit  The first 787 taking off on its maiden flight in December 2009 On December 15, 2009, Boeing conducted the 787-8 maiden flight from Paine Field in Everett, Washington , at 1027  am PST and landed three hours later at 133  p.m. at Seattles Boeing Field , after reaching 180  kn 333  kmh and 13,200  ft 4,000  m. 100  Originally scheduled for 5 1  2 hours, the test flight was shortened to three hours with the pilots wanting to complete the flight under visual meteorological conditions while visibility and cloud ceiling were low. 101  The 6,800h, six-aircraft ground and flight test programme was scheduled in eight and a half months, the fastest certification campaign for a new Boeing commercial design. 102  The flight test program comprised six aircraft, ZA001 through ZA006, four with Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines and two with GE GEnx -1B64 engines. The second 787, ZA002 in All Nippon Airways livery , flew to Boeing Field on December 22, 2009, to join the flight test program 103  104  the third 787, ZA004 made its first flight on February 24, 2010, followed by ZA003 on March 14, 2010. 105  On March 24, 2010, flutter and ground effects testing was completed, clearing the aircraft to fly its entire flight envelope . 106  On March 28, 2010, the 787 completed the ultimate wing load test, which requires that the wings of a fully assembled aircraft be loaded to 150 of design limit load and held for 3 seconds. The wings were flexed approximately 25  ft 7.6  m upward during the test. 107  Unlike past aircraft, the wings were not tested to failure. 108  109  On April 7, data showed the test had been a success. 110  On April 23, 2010, the newest 787, ZA003, arrived at the McKinley Climatic Laboratory hangar at Eglin Air Force Base , Florida, for extreme weather testing in temperatures ranging from 115 to 45  F 46 to 43  C, including takeoff preparations at both temperature extremes. 111  ZA005, the fifth 787 and the first with GEnx engines, began ground engine tests in May 2010, 112  and made its first flight on June 16, 2010. 113  In June 2010, gaps were discovered in the horizontal stabilizers of test aircraft due to improperly installed shims all aircraft were inspected and repaired. 114  That same month, a 787 experienced its first in-flight lightning strike inspections found no damage. 115  As composites can have as little as 11,000th the electrical conductivity of aluminum, conductive material is added to alleviate potential risks and to meet FAA requirements. 80  116  117  The FAA also planned requirement changes to help the 787 show compliance. 118  The first 787 to visit Europe, ZA003 at the 2010 Farnborough Airshow The 787 made its first appearance at an international air show at the Farnborough Airshow , United Kingdom, on July 18, 2010. 119  On August 2, 2010, a Trent 1000 engine suffered a blowout at Rolls-Royces test facility during ground testing. 120  This engine failure caused a reevaluation of the timeline for installing Trent 1000 engines on August 27, 2010, Boeing stated that the first delivery to launch customer ANA would be delayed until early 2011. 121  122  That same month, Boeing faced compensation claims from airlines owing to ongoing delivery delays. 123  In September 2010, it was reported that a further two 787s might join the test fleet for a total of eight flight test aircraft. 124  On September 10, 2010, a partial engine surge occurred in a Trent engine on ZA001 at Roswell. 125  On October 4, 2010, the sixth 787, ZA006 joined the test program with its first flight. 126  On November 9, 2010, the second 787, ZA002 made an emergency landing at Laredo International Airport , Texas, after smoke and flames were detected in the main cabin during a test flight. 127  128  The electrical fire caused some systems to fail before landing. 129  Following this incident, Boeing suspended flight testing on November 10, 2010 ground testing continued. 130  131  After investigation, the in-flight fire was primarily attributed to foreign object debris FOD that was present in the electrical bay. 132  After electrical system and software changes, the 787 resumed flight testing on December 23, 2010. 133  134  On November 5, 2010, it was reported that some 787 deliveries would be delayed to address problems found during flight testing. 135  136  In January 2011, the first 787 delivery was rescheduled to the third quarter of 2011 due to software and electrical updates following the in-flight fire. 137  138  By February 24, 2011, the 787 had completed 80 of the test conditions for Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine and 60 of the conditions for the General Electric GEnx-1B engine. 139  In July 2011, ANA performed a week of operations testing using a 787 in Japan. 140  The test aircraft had flown 4,828 hours in 1,707 flights combined by August 15, 2011. 105  During testing, the 787 visited 14 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America to test in extreme climates and conditions and for route testing. 141  The 787-8 received FAA and EASA certification on August 21, 2011. On August 13, 2011, certification testing of the Rolls-Royce powered 787-8 finished. 142  The FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency certified the 787 on August 26, 2011, at a ceremony in Everett, Washington. 143  144  Certification had taken 18 months, twice as long as originally planned. Service entry and early operations  edit  Certification cleared the way for deliveries and in 2011, Boeing prepared to increase 787 production rates from two to ten aircraft per month at assembly lines in Everett and Charleston over two years. 144  Legal difficulties clouded production at Charleston on April 20, 2011, the National Labor Relations Board alleged that a second production line in South Carolina violated two sections of the National Labor Relations Act. 97  In December 2011, the National Labor Relations Board dropped its lawsuit after the Machinists union withdrew its complaint as part of a new contract with Boeing. 145  The first 787 assembled at South Carolina was rolled out on April 27, 2012. 146  The first 787 was officially delivered to All Nippon Airways ANA on September 25, 2011, at the Boeing factory. A ceremony to mark the occasion was also held the next day. 147  148  On September 27, it flew to Tokyo Haneda Airport . 149  150  The airline took delivery of the second 787 on October 13, 2011. 151  All Nippon Airways 787 JA801A flew the first commercial flight from Tokyo Narita Airport to Hong Kong International Airport on October 26, 2011. On October 26, 2011, an ANA 787 flew the first commercial flight from Tokyo Narita Airport to Hong Kong International Airport . 152  The airliner entered service some three years later than originally planned. Tickets for the flight were sold in an online auction the highest bidder had paid 34,000 for a seat. 153  An ANA 787 flew its first long-haul flight to Europe on January 21, 2012 from Haneda to Frankfurt Airport . 154  On December 6, 2011, test aircraft ZA006 sixth 787, powered by General Electric GEnx engines, flew 10,710  nmi 19,830  km non-stop from Boeing Field eastward to Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka , Bangladesh, setting a new world distance record for aircraft in the 787s weight class, which is between 440,000 and 550,000  lb 200,000 and 250,000  kg. This flight surpassed the previous record of 9,127 nautical miles 16,903  km, set in 2002 by an Airbus A330 . The Dreamliner then continued eastbound from Dhaka to return to Boeing Field, setting a world-circling speed record of 42 hours, 27 minutes. 155  In December 2011, Boeing started a six-month promotion 787 world tour, visiting various cities in China, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, United States, and others. 156  In April 2012, an ANA 787 made a delivery flight from Boeing Field to Haneda Airport partially using biofuel from cooking oil. 157  ANA surveyed 800 passengers who flew the 787 from Tokyo to Frankfurt expectations were surpassed for 90 of passengers features that met or exceeded expectations included air quality and cabin pressure 90 of passengers, cabin ambiance 92 of passengers, higher cabin humidity levels 80 of passengers, headroom 40 of passengers and the larger windows 90 of passengers. 25 said they would go out of their way to again fly on the 787. 158  The second and third United Airlines 787-8s at Los Angeles International Airport . United Airlines is the North American launch customer for all three 787 variants. After its first six months of service, Rolls-powered ANA aircraft were burning around 21 less fuel than the replaced 767-300ER on international flights, slightly better than the 20 originally expected, and 1520 on domestic routes, while GE-powered Japan Airlines aircraft were potentially slightly better. 159  Other 787 operators have reported similar fuel savings, ranging from 2022 compared with the 767-300ER. 160  An analysis by consultant AirInsight concluded that United Airlines  787s achieved an operating cost per seat that was 6 lower than the Airbus A330. 161  In November 2017, International Airlines Group chief Willie Walsh said that for its budget carrier Level the lower cost of ownership of its two A330-200 more than offsets the 13,000  lb 6  t higher fuel burn 3,500 on a Barcelona-Los Angeles flight. It would introduce three more A330s as there were not enough 787 pilots. 162  Early operators discovered that if the APS5000 Auxiliary power unit was shut down with the inlet door closed, heat continued to build up in the tail compartment and cause the rotor shaft to bow. It could take up to 2 hours for the shaft to straighten again. This was particularly acute on short haul flights as there was insufficient time to allow the unit to cool before a restart was needed. Procedures were modified and the APU was later redesigned to address the issue. 163  On September 15, 2012, the NTSB requested the grounding of certain 787s due to GE engine failures GE believed the production problem had been fixed by that time. 164  In March 2014, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries informed Boeing of a new problem that was caused by a change in manufacturing processes. Employees did not fill gaps with shims to connect wing rib aluminum shear ties to the carbon composite wing panels the tightened fasteners, without shims, cause excessive stress that creates hairline cracks in the wings, which could enlarge and cause further damage. Forty-two aircraft awaiting delivery were affected, and each one required 12 weeks to inspect and repair. However, Boeing did not expect this problem to affect the overall delivery schedule, even if some airplanes were delivered late. 165  Dispatch reliability is an industry standard measure of the rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues. 166  The 787-8 started out with a 96 operational reliability, increasing to 98.5 in April 2015. Daily utilization increased from five hours in 2013 to twelve hours in 2014. 167  Dispatch reliability grew to 99.3 in 2017. 168  Airlines have often assigned the 787 to routes previously flown by larger aircraft that could not return a profit. For example, Air Canada offered a Toronto to New Delhi route, first utilizing a Lockheed L1011 , then a Boeing 747, then an Airbus A340 , but none of these types were efficient enough to generate profit. The airline operated the route profitably with a 787-9, and credits the right number of seats and greater fuel efficiency for this success. 169  Up to June 30, 2017, after 565 units were delivered since 2011 60 -8 340 and 40 -9 225, the airports with most 787 departures are Haneda airport with 304 weekly, Narita with 276 and Doha Airport with 265. By the end of 2017, there were 39 airlines operating the 787 on 983 routes with an average length of 5,282  km 2,852  nmi, including 163 new routes 17. 170  As of 24  March  2018 update  , the 787s longest route is Qantas  Perth-London Heathrow, a distance of 14,499  km 7,829  nmi and the second-longest regular scheduled flight behind Qatar Airways 14,529  km 7,845  nmi route from Doha to Auckland, flown with a Boeing 777-200LR. 171  Market, costs, and production issues  edit  A 787-8 of Norwegian Long Haul . A fully owned subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle , Norwegian Long Haul is an unusual example of a low cost carrier which exclusively uses the Dreamliner. The 787 Dreamliner program has reportedly cost Boeing 32 billion. 2  172  In 2013, the 787 program was expected to be profitable after 1,100 aircraft have been sold. 173  The cost of producing a 787 exceeded the purchase price at the end of 2013. Boeings accounting method books sales immediately and distributes estimated production costs over ten years for the 1,300 aircraft it expects to deliver during that time. JPMorgan Chase analyst Joseph Nadol estimated the programs cash loss to be 45 million per airplane, decreasing as the program moves forward. The actual cash flow reflects Boeing collecting most of the purchase price upon delivery Boeing expects deferred costs to total 25 billion before the company begins to break even on production the comparable number for the Boeing 777 , adjusted for inflation, is 3.7 billion. Boeing plans to improve financial return by reorganizing the production line, renegotiating contracts with suppliers and labor unions, and increasing the 787 production rate, stepwise, to 12 airplanes per month by the end of 2016 and 14 airplanes per month by the end of the decade. 161  As of April 2015 update  , the production rate is 10 per month 174  Boeing lost 30 million per 787 delivered in the first quarter of 2015, although Boeing plans to break even by the end of the year. 175  The accumulated losses for the 787 totalled almost 27 billion by May 2015. The cost of producing the fuselage may increase because of a tentative deal reached with Spirit Aerosystems of Wichita, Kansas , wherein severe price cuts demanded by Boeing would be eased, in return for a comprehensive agreement that lowers the cost of fuselages for other jetliners that Spirit helps Boeing manufacture. 176  In the second quarter of 2015, Boeing lost 25 million on each 787 delivered but was planning to break-even per plane before the year end. After that Boeing hopes to build 900 Dreamliners over six years at an average profit of more than 35 million each. But with deferred costs peaking in 2016 at 33 billion, Leeham analyst Bjorn Fehrm believes Boeing cant make an overall profit on the program. Ted Piepenbrock, an academic affiliated with the MIT and the University of Oxford , projects losses decreasing through the first 700 airliners, forecast the cumulative deferred costs to peak beyond 34 billion and its model most favorable to Boeing projects a program loss of 5 billion after delivering 2,000 Dreamliners. Boeings original development investment, estimated at least at a further 20 billion, isnt included in these costs. 177  To recoup the deferred costs and earn its goal of low single digit overall profit margin, Boeing has to make an average profit of more than 50 million on the final 205 airplanes of the accounting block to be delivered from 2020 a profit margin of more than 30 while the mature Boeing 737 and 777 programs have 20 to 25 margins. Boeing is reaching it through a larger proportion of the 20 to 40 higher price -910s, costing only 5 to 10 more than the -8 with lower production costs from reliability and producibility investments and the expected experience curve . Former Douglas Aircraft chief economist Adam Pilarski notes that two assembly sites slows the experience curve. Boeing assumed a faster improvement than on previous programs which has not happened. Airbus concurrence with the A350 and the launch of the A330neo put strong pressure on the 787 pricing. 177  On July 21, 2016 Boeing reported charges of 847 million against two flight-test 787s built in 2009. Boeing had planned to refurbish and sell them, but instead wrote them off as research and development expense. 178  Boeing will build 14 787s per month 168 per year from 2019, helping to offset the 28 billion in deferred production costs accumulated through 2015, and will add 100 aircraft to the current accounting block of 1,300 at the end of the 2017 third quarter. 179  Boeings Jim Albaugh said that the requested return on net assets RONA led to outsourcing systems reducing investment , but improving RONA had to be balanced against the risk of loss of control. 180  The valuation for a new 787-9 is 145 million in 2018, up from 135 million in 2014, but it may have been sold for 11015 million to prevent A330neo sales while an A330-900 is worth 115 million. 181  In February 2018, Boeing priced six 787-9s for less than 100115m each to Hawaiian Airlines , close to their production cost of 8090m, to overcome its A330-800 order. 182  By late 2018, deferred production costs were reduced from a peak of 27.6 billion in early 2016 to 23.5 billion as assembly efficiency improved and the 800th production started. 183  On April 20, 2019, The New York Times uncovered production quality issues in the 787 Dreamliner assembly line at the Boeing South Carolina assembly site. 184  Design  edit  Overview  edit  A Boeing 787-8 taking off from Boeing Field Front view of a British Airways Boeing 787-8 arriving at Londons Heathrow Airport 2015 The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a long-haul, widebody, twin-engine jetliner, which features light-weight construction. The aircraft is 80 composite by volume 185  Boeing lists its materials by weight as 50 composite, 20 aluminum , 15 titanium , 10 steel, and 5 other. 186  187  Aluminum has been used throughout the wing and tail leading edges, titanium is predominantly present within the elements of the engines and fasteners, while various individual components are composed of steel. 187  External features include a smooth nose contour, raked wingtips and engine nacelles with noise-reducing serrated edges  chevrons . 188  The longest-range 787 variant can fly 8,000 to 8,500 nautical miles 9,200 to 9,800  mi 14,800 to 15,700  km, enough to cover the Los Angeles to Bangkok and New York City to Hong Kong routes. Its cruising airspeed is Mach 0.85, 189  equivalent to 561  mph 903  kmh 487  kn at typical cruise altitudes. The aircraft has a design life of 44,000 flight cycles. 190  Flight systems  edit  Among 787 flight systems, a key change from traditional airliners is the electrical architecture. The architecture is bleedless and replaces bleed air with electrically powered compressors and four of six hydraulic power sources with electrically driven pumps, while completely eliminating pneumatics and hydraulics from some subsystems, e.g. engine starters and brakes. 191  Boeing says that this system extracts 35 less power from the engines, allowing increased thrust and improved fuel efficiency. 192  The total available on-board electrical power is 1.45 megawatts, which is five times the power available on conventional pneumatic airliners 193  the most notable electrically powered systems include engine start, cabin pressurization, horizontal-stabilizer trim, and wheel brakes. 194  Wing ice protection is another new system it uses electro-thermal heater mats on the wing slats instead of traditional hot bleed air . 195  196  An active gust alleviation system, similar to the system used on the B-2 bomber, improves ride quality during turbulence. 197  198  The Boeing 787 flight deck The 787 has a  fly-by-wire  control system similar in architecture to that of the Boeing 777 . 199  The flight deck features multi-function LCDs, which use an industry-standard graphical user interface widget toolkit Cockpit Display System Interfaces to User Systems  ARINC 661 . 200  The 787 flight deck includes two head-up displays HUDs as a standard feature. 201  Like other Boeing airliners, the 787 uses a yoke instead of a side-stick . Under consideration is future integration of forward-looking infrared into the HUD for thermal sensing, allowing pilots to see through clouds. 6  Lockheed Martin s Orion spacecraft will use a glass cockpit derived from Honeywell International s 787 flight deck systems. 202  Honeywell and Rockwell Collins provide flight control, guidance, and other avionics systems, including standard dual head-up guidance systems , 6  Thales supplies the integrated standby flight display and power management, 6  while Meggitt Securaplane provides the auxiliary power unit APU starting system, electrical power-conversion system, and battery-control system 203  204  with lithium cobalt oxide LiCoO 2  batteries by GS Yuasa . 205  206  One of the two batteries weighs 28.5  kg and is rated 29.6  V, 76  Ah, giving 2.2  kWh. 207  Battery charging is controlled by four independent systems to prevent overcharging, following early lab testing. 208  The battery systems were the focus of a regulatory investigation due to multiple lithium battery fires , which led to grounding of the 787 fleet starting in January 2013. 209  A version of Ethernet  Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet AFDX  ARINC 664 transmits data between the flight deck and aircraft systems. 210  The control, navigation, and communication systems are networked with the passenger cabins in-flight internet systems. 211  In January 2008, FAA concerns were reported regarding possible passenger access to the 787s computer networks Boeing has stated that various protective hardware and software solutions are employed, including air gaps to physically separate the networks, and firewalls for software separation. 211  212  These measures prevent data transfer from the passenger internet system to the maintenance or navigation systems. 211  The -910 hybrid laminar flow control HLFC system delays the critical transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far back as possible on the vertical tail by passive suction from leading-edge holes to mid-fin low-pressure doors, but was dropped from the tailplane due to lower benefits than the extra complexity and cost. 213  Composite materials  edit  Disassembled composite fuselage section of the Boeing 787 The 787 is the first major commercial airplane to have a composite fuselage, composite wings, and use composites in most other airframe components. 214  Each 787 contains approximately 77,000 pounds 35 metric tons of carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP, made with 51,000  lb 23  t of carbon fiber. 215  Carbon fiber composites have a higher strength-to-weight ratio than conventional aircraft materials, and help make the 787 a lighter aircraft. 187  Composites are used on fuselage, wings, tail, doors, and interior. Boeing had built and tested the first commercial aircraft composite section while studying the proposed Sonic Cruiser in the early 2000s. 216  217  The first carbonepoxy primary structure was put into service on the Boeing 737 Classic horizontal tail in 1984, and the largest use of composite structures is 60 percent in the BoeingSikorsky RAH-66 Comanche . 218  Carbon fiber, unlike metal, does not visibly show cracks and fatigue, prompting concerns about the safety risks of widespread use of the material 80  219  220  the rival Airbus A350 XWB uses composite panels on a frame, a more conventional approach, which its contractors regarded as less risky. 81  Although fired in 2006, Boeing engineer Vince Weldon complained to management, and later to the public the composite fuselage was unsafe compared to conventional aluminum designs, and in a crash, was more likely to shatter too easily and burn with toxic fumes. 221  In addition, a potential issue is the porous nature of composite materials collected moisture expanding with altitude can cause delamination . 222  Boeing responded that composites have been used on wings and other passenger aircraft parts for many years without incident, and special defect detection procedures will be instituted for the 787 to detect any potential hidden damage. 223  In 2006, Boeing launched the 787 GoldCare program. 224  This is an optional, comprehensive life-cycle management service, whereby aircraft in the program are routinely monitored and repaired, as needed. Although the first program of its kind from Boeing, post-sale protection programs are not new such programs are usually offered by third party service centers. Boeing is also designing and testing composite hardware so inspections are mainly visual. This reduces the need for ultrasonic and other non-visual inspection methods, saving time and money. 225  Engines  edit  The chevron-toothed exhaust duct covers on the first 787, shown here with thrust-reversers deployed The 787 is powered by two engines these engines use all-electrical bleedless systems, eliminating the superheated air conduits normally used for aircraft power, de-icing, and other functions. 6  As part of its Quiet Technology Demonstrator 2 project, Boeing adopted several engine noise-reducing technologies for the 787. These include an air inlet containing sound-absorbing materials and exhaust duct cover with a chevron -toothed pattern on the rim for a quieter mixing of exhaust and outside air. 188  Boeing expects these developments to make the 787 significantly quieter both inside and out. 226  The noise-reducing measures prevent sounds above 85 decibels from leaving airport boundaries. 187  The two different engine models compatible with the 787 use a standard electrical interface to allow an aircraft to be fitted with either Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 or General Electric GEnx engines. This interchangeability aims to save time and cost when changing engine types 6  while previous aircraft could exchange engines for those of a different manufacturer, the high cost and time required made it rare. 227  228  In 2006, Boeing addressed reports of an extended change period by stating that the 787 engine swap was intended to take 24 hours. 228  In 2016, Rolls Royce began flight testing its new Trent 1000 TEN engine. It has a new compressor system based on the compressor in Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engine and a new turbine design for extra thrust, up to 78,000  lbf 350  kN. Rolls Royce plans to offer the TEN on the 787-8, -9 and -10. 229  In early 2018, of 1277 orders, 681 selected GE 53.3, 420 Rolls-Royce 32.9 and 176 were undecided 13.8. 230  Interior  edit  ANAs first 787 Dreamliner with 242 economy class seating. The aircrafts larger windows, designed to improve passenger views, are shown. The 787-8 is designed to typically seat 234 passengers in a three-class setup, 240 in two-class domestic configuration, and 296 passengers in a high-density economy arrangement. Seat rows can be arranged in four to seven abreast in first or business, e.g. 121, 222, or 232. Eight or nine abreast are options in economy, e.g. 323, 242, or 333. Typical seat room ranges from 46 to 61  in 120 to 150  cm pitch in first, 36 to 39  in 91 to 99  cm in business, and 32 to 34  in 81 to 86  cm in economy. 231  232  Cabin interior width is approximately 18 feet 550  cm at armrest level. 231  233  The Dreamliners cabin width is 15 inches 38  cm more than that of the Airbus A330 and A340, 234  5 inches 13  cm less than the A350, 235  and 16  in 41  cm less than the 777. 236  The 787s economy seats can be up to 17.5  in 44.4  cm wide for nine-abreast seating 237  and up to 19 inches 48  cm wide for eight-abreast seating arrangements. Most airlines are selecting the nine-abreast 333 configuration. 238  239  The 787s nine-abreast seating for economy provides passengers less space, particularly across the hips and shoulders, than any other jet airliner. 240  Some observers recommended passengers avoid flying 787s with nine-abreast seating, 240  241  although others suggested that the 787 is more comfortable than other airliners. 242  Boeing 787-8 demonstrator aircraft cabin with economy class seating in conventional 333 layout The 787s cabin windows are larger than any other civil air transport in-service or in development, 243  with dimensions of 10.7 by 18.4  in 27 by 47  cm, 243  and a higher eye level so passengers can maintain a view of the horizon. 244  The composite fuselage permits larger windows without the need for structural reinforcement. 245  Instead of plastic window shades, the windows use electrochromism -based smart glass supplied by PPG Industries  246  allowing flight attendants 247  and passengers to adjust five levels of sunlight and visibility to their liking, 248  reducing cabin glare while maintaining a view to the outside world, 244  249  but the most opaque setting still has some transparency. 247  250  The lavatory, however, has a traditional sunshade. 248  The 787s cabin features light-emitting diodes LEDs 251  as standard equipment, allowing the aircraft to be entirely bulbless. LED lights have previously been an option on the Boeing 777 and Airbus aircraft. 252  253  The system has three-color LEDs plus a white LED. 251  The 787 interior was designed to better accommodate persons with mobility, sensory, and cognitive disabilities. For example, a 56 by 57  in 140 by 140  cm convertible lavatory includes a movable center wall that allows two separate lavatories to become one large, wheelchair-accessible facility. 254  Qatar Airways 787-8 business class cabin in 1-2-1 layout The 787s internal cabin pressure is the equivalent of 6,000 feet 1,800  m altitude resulting in a higher pressure than for the 8,000 feet 2,400  m altitude of older conventional aircraft. 255  According to Boeing, in a joint study with Oklahoma State University , this will significantly improve passenger comfort. 197  256  Cabin air pressurization is provided by electrically driven compressors, rather than traditional engine-bleed air, thereby eliminating the need to cool heated air before it enters the cabin. 257  258  The cabins humidity is programmable based on the number of passengers carried and allows 15 humidity settings instead of the 4 found in previous aircraft. 255  The composite fuselage avoids metal fatigue issues associated with higher cabin pressure and eliminates the risk of corrosion from higher humidity levels. 255  The cabin air-conditioning system improves air quality by removing ozone from outside air and, besides standard HEPA filters, which remove airborne particles , uses a gaseous filtration system to remove odors, irritants, and gaseous contaminants, as well as particulates like viruses, bacteria and allergens. 187  249  Variants  edit  Size comparison of the Boeing 787-8  black outline  with the Boeing 777-300  gray , 767-300  teal , and 737-800  blue  Thomson Airways 787-8 at Hannover Airport in June 2013 The first 787-9 in service, operated by launch customer Air New Zealand , landing at the inaugural destination, Perth Airport The shortest Dreamliner variant, the 787-8 was the first variant to fly in December 2009, then the longer 787-9 in September 2013, to be followed by the longest variant, the 787-10. They are called B788 , B789 , and B78X in the List of ICAO aircraft type designators . 259  The short-range 787-3 was cancelled in 2010. 787-8  edit  With a typical capacity of 242 passengers and a range of 7,355 nautical miles 13,621  km 8,464  mi, the -8 is the base model of the 787 family and was the first to enter service in 2011. 260  The 787-8 is targeted to replace the Boeing 767 -200ER and -300ER, as well as expand into new non-stop markets where larger planes would not be economically viable. As of May  2019 update  , approximately 31 of 787 orders are for the 787-8 with 361 delivered. 1  In 2018, Boeing said it would change the -8 manufacturing to raise its commonality with the -9 above the current 30 to be more like the 95 commonality between the -9 and -10, as it will benefit from learning from those. 261  When it was launched, a new B787-8 was to cost only slightly more than the B767-300ER , valued new for 85 million at its 1990s peak, but it ended being 20 more costly. 262  787-9  edit  Keeping the same wingspan as the 787-8, the 787-9 is a lengthened and strengthened variant with a 20 feet 6.1  m longer fuselage and a 54,500 pounds 24,700  kg higher maximum take-off weight MTOW, seating 280 passengers in a typical three-class arrangement over a 7,635 nautical miles 8,786  mi 14,140  km range. 260  It features active boundary-layer control on the tail surfaces, reducing drag. 263  In 2005, the entry into service EIS was planned for 2010. The firm configuration was finalized on July 1, 2010. 264  By October 2011, deliveries were scheduled to begin in 2014. 265  The prototype 787-9 made its maiden flight from Paine Field on September 17, 2013. 266  By November 8, 2013, it had flown 141 hours. 267  A 787-9 was on static display at the 2014 Farnborough Air Show prior to first delivery. 268  On July 8, 2014, Launch customer Air New Zealand took its first 787-9, in a distinctive black livery in a ceremony at Paine Field. 269  Its first commercial flight was from Auckland to Sydney on August 9, 2014. 270  The 787-9 was to begin commercial service with All Nippon Airways on August 7, 2014. 271  United Airlines was to start the longest nonstop scheduled 787 service between Los Angeles and Melbourne in October 2014. 272  Air China started a 787-9 route between Beijing and Chengdu in May 2016. 273  As of May  2019 update  , 57 of all 787 orders are for the 787-9, with 452 deliveries. 1  A 2014 787-9 leased for 1.05 million per month, and fell to 925,000 per month in 2018. 274  The 20-ft stretch was achieved by adding a 10-ft five-frame extension forward and aft. The 787-8 and 787-9 have 50 commonality  the wing, fuselage and systems of the 787-8 had required radical revision to achieve the payload -range goals of the 787-9. Following a major revamp of the original 787-8 wing, the latest configuration for the 787-9 and -10 is the fourth design evolution. 275  On March 25, 2018, a Qantas 787-9 completed the first scheduled non-stop flight between Australia and the UK flying seventeen hours from Perth to London Heathrow . 276  787-10  edit  Rollout of 787-10 with US President Trump on February 17, 2017 In December 2005, pushed by the interest of Emirates and Qantas , Boeing was studying the possibility of stretching the 787-9 further to seat 290 to 310 passengers. This variant would be similar to the capacity of the Airbus A350-900 and Boeing 777-200ER. 277  Customer discussions were continuing in early 2006. 278  Mike Bair, Boeings vice president and general manager for the 787 development program at the time, said it was easier to proceed with the 787-10 development after other customers followed Emirates request. 279  On May 30, 2013, Singapore Airlines SIA became the launch customer by stating it would order 30 787-10s provided Boeing launched the program, to be delivered in 20182019. 280  281  On June 18, 2013, Boeing officially launched the 787-10 at the Paris Air Show, with orders or commitments for 102 aircraft from Air Lease Corporation 30, Singapore Airlines 30, United Airlines 20, British Airways 12, and GE Capital Aviation Services 10. 282  As of February 2019 the aircraft has 173 orders out of which 18 have been delivered. 283  The variant was envisioned as replacing Boeing 777-200, Airbus A330 and Airbus A340 aircraft. 284  The -10 is to compete against the Airbus A350-900, and offer better economics than the A350 on shorter routes, according to Boeing. 285  Steven Udvar-Hazy said If its identically configured, the -10 has a little bit of an edge on the -900, but smaller than Boeings estimate of 10 percent. 286  The 787-10 is to be 224  ft 68  m long, seat 330 passengers in a two-class cabin configuration, and have a range of 6,430  nmi 11,910  km 7,400  mi. 287  Final assembly of the second 787-10 Boeing completed detailed design for the -10 on December 2, 2015. 288  Major assembly began in March 2016. 289  Designers targeted 90 commonality between the 787-9 and -10 and achieved 95 the 18-ft stretch was reached by adding 10  ft forward of the wing and 8  ft aft, and by strengthening the fuselage for bending loads in the center wingbox . Because of the length and additional tail strike protection needed, a semilevered landing gear enables rotation over the aft wheels rather than at the bogie center, like the 777-300ER, and the cabin air conditioning system has 15 more capacity. The first and third -10s have Rolls-Royces new Trent 1000 TEN engines, while the second is powered by the competing General Electric GEnx -1B engine. 275  Major fuselage parts were received for final assembly on November 30, 2016. The 787-10s mid-fuselage sections are too large for transport to Everett, Washington and it is built only in Charleston, South Carolina 290  it is the first Boeing airliner assembled exclusively there. 291  The first -10 was rolled out on February 17, 2017. 292  The variants first flight took place on March 31, 2017 and lasted 4 hours and 48 minutes. 293  The first test 787-10 aircraft is engaged in flight envelope expansion work and the second joined the program in early May 2017, while the third with a passenger cabin interior to test the uprated environmental control system and Trent fuel-burn performance was scheduled to join in June. The -10 was scheduled to appear at the 2017 Paris Air Show . 291  The second -10 is being used to prove the GE Aviation engines and the third made its first flight on June 8, 2017, when the flight-test programme was 30 complete. 294  Boeing finished final assembly and painting of the first production 787-10 in October 2017, before its certification. 295  The flight tests are mainly ahead of schedule, with the last stages focused on fuel burn validation and revised flight control software , the phase should be completed in December 2017 and could advance first deliveries earlier than expected in 2018. 296  At the start of the November 2017 Dubai Air Show the 787-10 had 171 orders Emirates committed to 40 787-10s, in two- and three-class cabins for 240 to 330 passengers, to be delivered from 2022 and with conversion rights to the smaller 787-9. 297  298  These aircraft are adapted for 78.5 hour missions, in a 280-seat threeclass layout. 299  Emirates Tim Clark was doubtful it would meet its MTOW for the payload-range required with initial 70,00072,000  lbf 310320  kN thrust engines, but with the current 76,000  lbf 340  kN turbofans and the -9 early margins gave the -10 stellar economics. 300  By early 2019, Emirates was considering canceling its 787-10 order, due to engine margins being insufficient for the hot Dubai weather, in favor of the A350 which would also replace its last A380 order. 301  The order was no longer mentioned in Emirates May 2019 annual report, whereas it was listed as authorised and not contracted in the previous report. 302  The -10 began commercial service on April 3, 2018 with Singapore Airlines In January 2018, the -10 was certified by the FAA after testing for 900 flight hours. 303  Boeing received its production certificate on February 15. 304  It was first delivered to launch customer Singapore Airlines on March 25, 2018. 305  Fitted with 337 seats, 36 in business and 301 in economy, 306  the -10 began commercial service on April 3, 2018. 307  The 8.7 fuselage stretch from the -9 to the -10 likely increased empty weight at a lower rate than the 7.4 growth from the -8 to the -9 due to the 10.7 stretch. Software increases the tailplane effectiveness to avoid modifying it. With the same wing but a longer fuselage than the -9, the flutter margin was reduced for the -10 but to avoid stiffening the wing or adding wingtip counterweights for commonality, software oscillates the elevators in the flaps up vertical mode suppression system F0VMS, similar to the vertical gust load alleviation system. 213  BBJ 787  edit  Lufthansa Technik model of 787 VIP interior The 787-8 and -9 are offered as Boeing Business Jets , the first offering 2,415 sq ft 224.4 m of floor space and a range of 9,945 nmi 18,418  km, the other 2,775 sq ft 257,8 m and 9,485 nmi 17,566  km, both with 25 passengers. Through June 2018, fifteen have been ordered, twelve delivered and four were in service. 308  Other proposals  edit  Although with no set date, Boeing expects to build, possibly in the 20182023 timeframe, a 787 freighter version. 309  310  Boeing also reportedly considered a 787 variant as a candidate to replace the 747-based Boeing VC-25 presidential transport in 2009. 311  In 2018, two Boeing 747-8 aircraft were ordered to replace the two older 747-200-based VC-25A Air Force One aircraft. 312  787-3  edit  The 787-3 would have featured a shorter wing with winglets The 787-3 would have carried 290330 passengers in two-class over 2,5003,050  nmi 4,6305,650  km range, limited by a 364,000  lb 165  t MTOW . 313  In April 2008, to keep the -8 on track for delivery, the -9 stretch was postponed from 2010 to at least 2012 and prioritised before the 787-3 and its 43 orders to follow without a firm delivery date. 69  It kept the -8 length but its 51.7 m wingspan would have fit in ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code D. 314  It was designed to operate on Boeing 757 -300 Boeing 767 -200 sized regional routes from airports with restricted gate spacing. 315  The wingspan was decreased by using blended winglets instead of raked wingtips . By January 2010, all orders, from Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways , had been converted to the 787-8. 316  As it was designed specifically for the Japanese market, Boeing would likely scrap it after they switched orders. 317  The -8s longer wingspan makes it more efficient on stages longer than 370  km 200  nm. 318  In December 2010, Boeing withdrew the short-haul model as it struggled to produce the 787-8 after program delays of three years. 319  Operators  edit  Main article List of Boeing 787 operators There are 808 Boeing 787 aircraft in airline service as of July  2019 update  , comprising 328 787-8s, 451 787-9s and 29 787-10s, with outstanding orders for a further 483 aircraft. 320  The largest operators are All Nippon Airways 61, Japan Airlines 42, American Airlines 42, United Airlines 34, Air Canada 37, Norwegian 36, Qatar Airways 30, and Hainan Airlines 34. 320  Orders and deliveries  edit  Main article List of Boeing 787 orders and deliveries A 787 of LOT Polish Airlines , the first European operator 321  Air Canada s first 787-8 touching down at Toronto Pearson International Airport during a post-delivery test flight Air India 787-8 Dreamliner departs Londons Heathrow Airport , 2014.

By then the 787 had flown 300 million passengers on 1.5 million flights and opened 210 new nonstop routes. 323  Boeing 787 orders and deliveries by type view talk edit Total orders Total deliveries 787-8 444 363 787-9 829 476 787-10 189 32 Total 1,462 871 Boeing 787 net orders and deliveries by year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total Orders 56 235 157 369 93 -59 -4 13 -12 182 41 71 58 94 109 59 1,462 Deliveries 787-8        3 46 65 104 71 35 26 10 3 363 787-9           10 64 102 110 120 70 476 787-10               15 17 32 Total        3 46 65 114 135 137 136 145 90 871 Boeing 787 orders and deliveries cumulative, by year Orders Deliveries Orders and deliveries through July 2019 1  324  Accidents and notable incidents  edit  Three 787s of All Nippon Airways sit grounded at Tokyo Haneda International Airport in late January 2013. The Boeing 787 has been involved in one aviation incident . In December 2012, Boeing CEO James McNerney stated that the 787s issues were no greater than those experienced with the introduction of other models such as the Boeing 777 . 325  326  On August 10, 2019, Norwegian Air Flight DY7115 from Rome Fiumicino to Los Angeles suffered an uncontained engine failure of one of its Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines shortly after takeoff, and engine fragments fell on parts of Fiumicino, damaging houses and cars while one person was injured. 327   importance  Operational problems  edit  A Japan Airlines JAL 787 experienced a fuel leak on January 8, 2013, and its flight from Boston was canceled. 328  On January 9, United Airlines reported a problem in one of its six 787s with the wiring near the main batteries. After these incidents, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board subsequently opened a safety probe. 329  Later, on January 11, 2013, another aircraft was found to have a fuel leak. 330  Also on January 11, 2013, the FAA completed a comprehensive review of the 787s critical systems including the design, manufacture, and assembly. The Department of Transportation secretary Ray LaHood stated the administration was looking for the root causes behind the recent issues. The head of the FAA, Michael Huerta, said that so far nothing found suggests the 787 is not safe. 331  On January 13, 2013, a JAL 787 at Narita International Airport outside Tokyo was found to also have a fuel leak during an inspection, the third time a fuel leak had been reported within a week. The aircraft reportedly was the same one that had a fuel leak in Boston on January 8. 332  This leak was caused by a different valve the causes of the leaks are unknown. 333  Japans transport ministry has also launched an investigation. 334  On July 12, 2013, a fire started on an empty Ethiopian Airlines 787 parked at Heathrow Airport before it was extinguished by the airport fire and rescue service. No injuries were reported. 335  336  The fire caused extensive heat damage to the aircraft. 337  The FAA and NTSB sent representatives to assist in the investigation. 338  The initial investigation found no direct link with the aircrafts main batteries. 339  Further investigations indicated that the fire was due to lithium-manganese dioxide batteries powering an emergency locator transmitter ELT. 340  341  The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch AAIB issued a special bulletin on July 18, 2013, requesting the US FAA ensure that the locator is removed or disconnected in Boeing 787s and to review the safety of lithium battery-powered ELT systems in other aircraft types. 342  On August 19, 2015, the Associated Press reported that the fire was started by a short circuit caused by crossed wires located under the battery. The Air Accidents Investigation Branchs investigators recommended that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, together with similar bodies in Europe and Canada, should conduct a review of equipment powered by lithium metal batteries to ensure they have an acceptable level of circuit protection. 343  On July 26, 2013, ANA said it had found wiring damage on two 787 locator beacons. United Airlines also reported that it had found a pinched wire in one 787 locator beacon. 344  On August 14, 2013, the media reported a fire extinguisher fault affecting three ANA airplanes, which caused the fire extinguishers to discharge into the opposite engine from the one requested. 345  The fault was caused by a supplier assembly error. 346  On September 28, 2013, Norwegian Long Haul decided to take one of its two 787s in its fleet at the time out of service after the two aircraft broke down on more than six occasions in September. 347  The company planned to lease an Airbus A340 for its long-haul operations while the 787 is returned to Boeing for repair. 348   clarification needed  On November 22, 2013, Boeing issued an advisory to airlines using General Electric GEnx engines on 787 and 747-8 aircraft to avoid flying near high-level thunderstorms due to an increased risk of icing on the engines. The problem was caused by a buildup of ice crystals just behind the main fan causing a brief loss of thrust on six occasions. 349  On January 21, 2014, a Norwegian Air Shuttle 787 experienced a fuel leak which caused a 19-hour delay to a flight from Bangkok to Oslo. 350  Footage of the leak taken by passengers shows fuel gushing out of the left wing of the aircraft. 351  The leak became known to pilots only after it was pointed out by concerned passengers. 352  It was found later that a faulty valve was responsible. 353  This fuel leak is one of numerous problems experienced by Norwegian Air Shuttles 787 fleet. 350  Mike Fleming, Boeings vice president for 787 support and services, subsequently met with executives of Norwegian Air Shuttle and expressed Boeings commitment to improving the 787s dispatch reliability, were not satisfied with where the airplane is today, flying at a fleet average of 98 percent...The 777 today flies at 99.4 percent...and thats the benchmark that the 787 needs to attain. 354  355  In March 2016 the FAA accelerated the release of an airworthiness directive in response to reports indicating that in certain weather conditions erroneous low airspeed may be displayed... There was concern abrupt pilot control inputs in this condition could exceed the structural capability of the airplane. Pilots were told not to apply large, abrupt control column inputs in the event of an unrealistic drop in displayed airspeed. 356  357  On April 22, 2016, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive following a January 29 incident in which a General Electric GEnx -1B PIP2 engine suffered damage and non-restartable power loss while flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet. The damage is thought to have been caused by a fan imbalance resulting from fan ice shedding. 358  359  Lithium-ion battery problems  edit  Main article Boeing 787 Dreamliner battery problems The Aft Electronics Bay that held the JAL 787 battery that caught fire Japan Airlines 787 battery comparison Left typical original battery. Right damaged battery. On January 16, 2013, All Nippon Airways Flight NH-692, en route from Yamaguchi Ube Airport to Tokyo Haneda , had a battery problem warning followed by a burning smell while climbing from Ube about 35 nautical miles 65  km west of Takamatsu, Japan . The aircraft diverted to Takamatsu and was evacuated via the slides three passengers received minor injuries during the evacuation. Inspection revealed a battery fire. A similar incident in a parked Japan Airlines 787 at Boston s Logan International Airport within the same week led the Federal Aviation Administration to ground all 787s. 360  On January 16, 2013, both major Japanese airlines ANA and JAL voluntarily grounded their fleets of 787s after multiple incidents involving different 787s, including emergency landings. At the time, these two carriers operated 24 of the 50 787s delivered. 361  362  The grounding reportedly cost ANA some 9 billion yen US93 million in lost sales. 363  On January 16, 2013, the FAA issued an emergency airworthiness directive ordering all American-based airlines to ground their Boeing 787s until yet-to-be-determined modifications were made to the electrical system to reduce the risk of the battery overheating or catching fire. 364  This was the first time that the FAA had grounded an airliner type since 1979. 365  Industry experts disagreed on consequences of the grounding Airbus was confident that Boeing would resolve the issue 366  and that no airlines will switch plane type, 367  368  while other experts saw the problem as costly 369  and could take upwards of a year. 370  The FAA also conducted an extensive review of the 787s critical systems. The focus of the review was on the safety of the lithium-ion batteries 365  made of lithium cobalt oxide LiCoO 2 . The 787 battery contract was signed in 2005, 206  when this was the only type of lithium aerospace battery available, but since then newer and safer 371  types such as LiFePO 4 , which provide less reaction energy with virtually no cobalt content to avoid cobalts thermal runaway characteristic, have become available. 372  373  FAA approved a 787 battery in 2007 with nine special conditions. 374  375  A battery approved by FAA through Mobile Power Solutions was made by Rose Electronics using Kokam cells 376  the batteries installed in the 787 are made by Yuasa. 203  On January 20, the NTSB declared that overvoltage was not the cause of the Boston incident, as voltage did not exceed the battery limit of 32 V, 377  and the charging unit passed tests. The battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway. 378  Despite this, by January 24, the NTSB had not yet pinpointed the cause of the Boston fire the FAA would not allow U.S.-based 787s to fly again until the problem was found and corrected. In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must never happen on an airplane. 379  The Japan Transport Safety Board JTSB has said on January 23 that the battery in ANA jets in Japan reached a maximum voltage of 31 V below the 32 V limit like the Boston JAL 787, but had a sudden unexplained voltage drop 380  to near zero. 381  All cells had signs of thermal damage prior to runaway. 382  ANA and JAL had replaced several 787 batteries before the mishaps. 381  As of January  29, 2013 update  , JTSB approved the Yuasa factory quality control 383  384  while the NTSB examined the Boston battery for defects. 385  The failure rate, with two major battery thermal runaway events in 100,000 flight hours, was much higher than the rate of one in 10 million flight hours predicted by Boeing. 360  The only American airline that operated the Dreamliner at the time was United Airlines, which had six. 386  Chiles Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGAC grounded LAN Airlines three 787s. 387  The Indian Directorate General of Civil Aviation DGCA directed Air India to ground its six Dreamliners. The Japanese Transport Ministry made the ANA and JAL groundings official and indefinite following the FAA announcement. 388  The European Aviation Safety Agency also followed the FAAs advice and grounded the only two European 787s operated by LOT Polish Airlines . 389  Qatar Airways grounded their five Dreamliners. 390  Ethiopian Airlines was the final operator to temporarily ground its four Dreamliners. 391  By January 17, 2013, all 50 of the aircraft delivered to date had been grounded. 391  392  On January 18, Boeing halted 787 deliveries until the battery problem was resolved. 393  On February 7, 2013, the FAA gave approval for Boeing to conduct 787 test flights to gather additional data. 394  395  In February 2013, FAA oversight of the 787s 2007 safety approval and certification was under scrutiny. 396  On March 7, 2013, the NTSB released an interim factual report about the Boston battery fire on January 7, 2013. The investigation 397  stated that heavy smoke and fire coming from the front of the APU battery case. Firefighters tried fire extinguishing, but smoke and flame flame size about 3 inches did not stop. 398  399  Boeing completed its final tests on a revised battery design on April 5, 2013. 400  The FAA approved Boeings revised battery design with three additional, overlapping protection methods on April 19, 2013. 401  The FAA published a directive on April 25 to provide instructions for retrofitting battery hardware before the 787s could return to flight. 402  403  The repairs were expected to be completed in weeks. 401  Following the FAA approval in the U.S. effective April 26, 404  Japan approved resumption of Boeing 787 flights in the country on April 26, 2013. 405  On April 27, 2013, Ethiopian Airlines took a 787 on the models first commercial flight after battery system modifications. 403  404  On January 14, 2014, a battery in a JAL 787 emitted smoke from the batterys protection exhaust while the aircraft was undergoing pre-flight maintenance at Tokyo Narita Airport . 406  407  The battery partially melted in the incident 408  one of its eight lithium -ion cells had its relief port vent and fluid sprayed inside the batterys container. 409  It was later reported that the battery may have reached a temperature as high as 1,220  F 660  C, and that Boeing did not understand the root cause of the failure. 410  The NTSB has criticized FAA, Boeing, and battery manufacturers for the faults in a 2014 report. 411  412  413  414  It also criticized the GE -made flight data and cockpit voice recorder in the same report. 415  The enclosure Boeing added is 185  lb 84  kg heavier, negating the lighter battery potential. 416  Aircraft on display  edit  All three prototype 787-8s are preserved in museums.
