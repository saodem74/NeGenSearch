It was an open-sourced version of the earlier StarOffice , which Sun Microsystems acquired in 1999 for internal use. OpenOffice included a word processor Writer, a spreadsheet Calc, a presentation application Impress, a drawing application Draw, a formula editor Math, and a database management application Base. 9  Its default file format was the OpenDocument Format ODF, an ISO  IEC standard, which originated with OpenOffice.org. It could also read a wide variety of other file formats, with particular attention to those from Microsoft Office. Sun open-sourced the OpenOffice suite in July 2000 as a competitor to Microsoft Office , 10  11  releasing version 1.0 on 1 May 2002. 1  In 2011 Oracle Corporation , the then-owner of Sun, announced that it would no longer offer a commercial version of the suite 12  and donated the project to the Apache Foundation . 13  14  Apache renamed the software Apache OpenOffice . 15  Other active successor projects include LibreOffice the most actively developed 16  17  18   and NeoOffice commercial, only for macOS. OpenOffice.org was primarily developed for Linux , Microsoft Windows and Solaris , and later for OS X , with ports to other operating systems . It was distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3 LGPL early versions were also available under the Sun Industry Standards Source License SISSL.

In August 1999, Star Division was acquired by Sun Microsystems 19  20  for US59.5 million, 21  as it was supposedly cheaper than licensing Microsoft Office for 42,000 staff. 22  On 19 July 2000 at OSCON , Sun Microsystems announced it would make the source code of StarOffice available for download with the intention of building an open-source development community around the software and of providing a free and open alternative to Microsoft Office. 10  11  23  The new project was known as OpenOffice.org, 24  and the code was released as open source on 13 October 2000. 25  The first public preview release was Milestone Build 638c, released in October 2001 which quickly achieved 1 million downloads 19   the final release of OpenOffice.org 1.0 was on 1 May 2002. 1  OpenOffice.org became the standard office suite on Linux and spawned many derivative versions. It quickly became noteworthy competition to Microsoft Office, 26  27  achieving 14 penetration in the large enterprise market by 2004. 28  The OpenOffice.org XML file format  XML in a ZIP archive, easily machine-processable  was intended by Sun to become a standard interchange format for office documents, 29  to replace the different binary formats for each application that had been usual until then. Sun submitted the format to the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards OASIS in 2002 and it was adapted to form the OpenDocument standard in 2005, 30  which was ratified as ISO 26300 in 2006. 31  It was made OpenOffice.orgs native format from version 2 on. Many governments and other organisations adopted OpenDocument , particularly given there was a free implementation of it readily available. Development of OpenOffice.org was sponsored primarily by Sun Microsystems, which used the code as the basis for subsequent versions of StarOffice. Developers who wished to contribute code were required to sign a Contributor Agreement 32  33  granting joint ownership of any contributions to Sun and then Oracle, in support of the StarOffice business model. 34  This was controversial for many years. 23  35  36  37  38  An alternative Public Documentation Licence PDL 39  was also offered for documentation not intended for inclusion or integration into the project code base. 40  After acquiring Sun in January 2010, Oracle Corporation continued developing OpenOffice.org and StarOffice, which it renamed Oracle Open Office, 41  though with a reduction in assigned developers. 42  Oracles lack of activity on or visible commitment to OpenOffice.org had also been noted by industry observers. 43  In September 2010, the majority 44  45  of outside OpenOffice.org developers left the project, 46  47  due to concerns over Sun and then Oracles management of the project 48  49  50  and Oracles handling of its open source portfolio in general, 51  52  to form The Document Foundation TDF. TDF released the fork LibreOffice in January 2011, 53  which most Linux distributions soon moved to. 54  55  56  57  In April 2011, Oracle stopped development of OpenOffice.org 12  and fired the remaining Star Division development team. 34  58  Its reasons for doing so were not disclosed some speculate that it was due to the loss of mindshare with much of the community moving to LibreOffice 59  while others suggest it was a commercial decision. 34  In June 2011, Oracle contributed the trademarks to the Apache Software Foundation . 60  It also contributed Oracle-owned code to Apache for relicensing under the Apache License , 61  at the suggestion of IBM to whom Oracle had contractual obligations concerning the code, 23  62  as IBM did not want the code put under a copyleft license. 63  This code drop formed the basis for the Apache OpenOffice project. 64  Governance  edit  During Suns sponsorship, the OpenOffice.org project was governed by the Community Council , comprising OpenOffice.org community members. The Community Council suggested project goals and coordinated with producers of derivatives on long-term development planning issues. 65  66  67  Both Sun and Oracle are claimed to have made decisions without consulting the Council or in contravention to the councils recommendations, 68  69  leading to the majority of outside developers leaving for LibreOffice. 48  Oracle demanded in October 2010 that all Council members involved with the Document Foundation step down, 70  leaving the Community Council composed only of Oracle employees. 71  Naming  edit  The project and software were informally referred to as OpenOffice since the Sun release, but since this term is a trademark held by Open Office Automatisering in Benelux since 1999, 72  73  OpenOffice.org was its formal name. 74  Due to a similar trademark issue a Rio de Janeiro company that owned that trademark in Brazil, the Brazilian Portuguese version of the suite was distributed under the name BrOffice.org from 2004, with BrOffice.Org being the name of the associated local nonprofit from 2006. 75  BrOffice.org moved to LibreOffice in December 2010. 76   Features  edit  OpenOffice.org 1.0 was launched under the following mission statement  11   The mission of OpenOffice.org is to create, as a community, the leading international office suite that will run on all major platforms and provide access to all functionality and data through open-component based APIs and an XML-based file format.  Components  edit  Icon Title Description Writer A word processor analogous to Microsoft Word or WordPerfect . Calc A spreadsheet analogous to Microsoft Excel or Lotus 1-2-3 . Impress A presentation program analogous to Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote . Impress could export presentations to Adobe Flash SWF files, allowing them to be played on any computer with a Flash player installed. Presentation templates were available on the OpenOffice.org website. 77  78  Draw A vector graphics editor comparable in features to the drawing functions in Microsoft Office. Math A tool for creating and editing mathematical formulas, analogous to Microsoft Equation Editor . Formulas could be embedded inside other OpenOffice.org documents, such as those created by Writer. Base A database management program analogous to Microsoft Access . Base could function as a front-end to a number of different database systems, including Access databases JET, ODBC data sources, MySQL and PostgreSQL . Base became part of the suite starting with version 2.0. HSQL was the included database engine. From version 2.3, Base offered report generation via Pentaho . The suite contained no personal information manager , email client or calendar application analogous to Microsoft Outlook , despite one having been present in StarOffice 5.2. Such functionality was frequently requested. 79  The OpenOffice.org Groupware project, intended to replace Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server , spun off in 2003 as OpenGroupware.org, 80  which is now SOGo . The project considered bundling Mozilla Thunderbird and Mozilla Lightning for OpenOffice.org 3.0. 79  Supported operating systems  edit  The last version, 3.4 Beta 1, was available for IA-32 versions of Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 or later, Linux IA-32 and x64, Solaris and OS X 10.4 or later, and the SPARC version of Solaris. 4  81  The latest versions of OpenOffice.org on other operating systems were 82  IRIX  MIPS IV  v1.0.3 83  Mac OS X v10.2  v1.1.2 Mac OS X v10.3  v2.1 Windows 95  v1.1.5 Windows NT 4.0 SP6  v2.0.1 Windows 98 and Windows ME  v2.4.3 84  Fonts  edit  OpenOffice.org included OpenSymbol , DejaVu , 85  the Liberation fonts from 2.4 and the Gentium fonts from 3.2. 86  87  88  Versions up to 2.3 included the Bitstream Vera fonts. 85  89  OpenOffice.org also used the default fonts of the running operating system. Fontwork is a feature that allows users to create stylized text with special effects differing from ordinary text with the added features of gradient colour fills, shaping, letter height, and character spacing. It is similar to WordArt used by Microsoft Word. When OpenOffice.org saved documents in Microsoft Office file format, all Fontwork was converted into WordArt. 90  91  Extensions  edit  From version 2.0.4, OpenOffice.org supported third-party extensions. 92  As of April 2011, the OpenOffice Extension Repository listed more than 650 extensions. 93  Another list was maintained by the Free Software Foundation . 94  95  OpenOffice Basic  edit  Main article OpenOffice Basic OpenOffice.org included OpenOffice Basic, a programming language similar to Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications VBA. OpenOffice Basic was available in Writer, Calc and Base. 96  OpenOffice.org also had some Microsoft VBA macro support. Connectivity  edit  OpenOffice.org could interact with databases local or remote using ODBC  Open Database Connectivity , JDBC  Java Database Connectivity  or SDBC StarOffice Database Connectivity. 97  File formats  edit  From Version 2.0 onward, OpenOffice.org used ISOIEC 263002006 98  OpenDocument as its native format. Versions 2.02.3.0 default to the ODF 1.0 file format versions 2.3.12.4.3 default to ODF 1.1 versions 3.0 onward default to ODF 1.2. OpenOffice.org 1 used OpenOffice.org XML as its native format. This was contributed to OASIS and OpenDocument was developed from it. 99  OpenOffice.org also claimed support for the following formats 100  101  Format Extension Reading Writing Notes OpenOffice.org XML SXW, STW, SXC, STC, SXI, STI, SXD, STD, SXM Yes Yes native up to 1.x Microsoft Word for Windows 2 DOC, DOT Yes Yes Microsoft Word 6.095 DOC, DOT Yes Yes Microsoft Word 972003 DOC, DOT Yes Yes Microsoft Word 2003 XML WordprocessingML XML Yes Yes Microsoft Excel 4595 XLS, XLW, XLT Yes Yes Microsoft Excel 972003 XLS, XLW, XLT Yes Yes DocBook XML Yes Yes since 1.1 WordPerfect WPD Yes WordPerfect Suite 2000Office 1.0 WPS Yes StarOffice StarWriter 345 SDW, SGL, VOR Yes Yes Ichitaro 891011 JTD, JTT Yes ApportisDoc Palm PDB Yes Yes Requires Java Hangul WP 97 HWP Yes Microsoft Pocket Word PSW Yes Yes Requires Java Microsoft Pocket Excel PXL Yes Yes Requires Java Microsoft RTF RTF Yes Yes you are likely to experience loss of formatting and images 101  Plain text TXT Yes Yes various encodings supported Portable Document Format PDF Yes Yes Export from 1.1 102  PDFA -1a ISO 19005-1 export from 2.4 89  103  some readable in Impress Comma-separated values CSV, TXT Yes Yes Microsoft Excel 2003 XML XML Yes Yes Lotus 1-2-3 WK1, WKS, 123 Yes Data Interchange Format DIF Yes Yes StarOffice StarCalc 345 SDC, VOR Yes Yes dBase DBF Yes Yes SYLK SLK Yes Yes HTML HTML, HTM Yes Yes Quattro Pro 6.0 WB2 Yes Microsoft PowerPoint 972003 PPT, PPS, POT Yes Yes StarOffice StarDrawStarImpress SDA, SDD, SDP, VOR Yes Yes Computer Graphics Metafile CGM Yes Binary-encoded only not those using clear-text or character based encoding StarOffice StarMath SXM Yes Yes MathML MML Yes BMP file format BMP Yes Yes JPEG JPG, JPEG Yes Yes PCX PCX Yes PhotoShop PSD Yes SGV SGV Yes Windows Metafile WMF Yes Yes AutoCAD DXF DXF Yes MET MET Yes Yes Netpbm format PGM, PBM, PPM Yes Yes SunOS Raster RAS Yes Yes SVM SVM Yes Yes X BitMap XBM Yes Enhanced Metafile EMF Yes Yes HPGL plotting file PLT Yes SDA SDA Yes Truevision TGA Targa TGA Yes X PixMap XPM Yes Yes Encapsulated PostScript EPS Yes Yes PCD PCD Yes Portable Network Graphic PNG Yes Yes SDD SDD Yes Tagged Image File Format TIF, TIFF Yes Yes Graphics Interchange Format GIF Yes Yes PCT PCT Yes Yes SGF SGF Yes Adobe Flash SWF Yes Export from Impress Scalable Vector Graphics SVG Yes Export from Draw Software602 T602 602, TXT Yes Uniform Office Format UOF, UOT, UOS, UOP Yes Yes since 3.0 Microsoft Office 2007 Office Open XML DOCX, XLSX, PPTX Yes read since 3.0 104  writing only in derivatives descended via go-oo Development  edit  OpenOffice.org converted all external formats to and from an internal XML representation. The OpenOffice.org API was based on a component technology known as Universal Network Objects UNO. It consisted of a wide range of interfaces defined in a CORBA -like interface description language . Native desktop integration  edit  OpenOffice.org 1.0 was criticized for not having the look and feel of applications developed natively for the platforms on which it runs. Starting with version 2.0, OpenOffice.org used native widget toolkit , icons, and font-rendering libraries on GNOME , KDE and Windows. 105  106  107  The issue had been particularly pronounced on Mac OS X. Early versions of OpenOffice.org required the installation of X11.app or XDarwin though the NeoOffice port supplied a native interface. Versions since 3.0 ran natively using Apples Aqua GUI . 108  Use of Java  edit  Although originally written in C, OpenOffice.org became increasingly reliant on the Java Runtime Environment, even including a bundled JVM . 109  OpenOffice.org was criticized by the Free Software Foundation for its increasing dependency on Java, which was not free software . 110  The issue came to the fore in May 2005, when Richard Stallman appeared to call for a fork of the application in a posting on the Free Software Foundation website. 110  OpenOffice.org adopted a development guideline that future versions of OpenOffice.org would run on free implementations of Java and fixed the issues which previously prevented OpenOffice.org 2.0 from using free-software Java implementations. 111  On 13 November 2006, Sun committed to releasing Java under the GNU General Public License 112  and had released a free software Java, OpenJDK , by May 2007. Security  edit  In 2006, Lt. Col. Eric Filiol of the Laboratoire de Virologie et de Cryptologie de lESAT demonstrated security weaknesses, in particular within macros. 113  114  115  In 2006, Kaspersky Lab demonstrated a proof of concept virus, Stardust, for OpenOffice.org. 116  This showed OpenOffice.org viruses are possible, but there is no known virus in the wild. As of October 2011, Secunia reported no known unpatched security flaws for the software. 117  A vulnerability in the inherited OpenOffice.org codebase was found and fixed in LibreOffice in October 2011 118  and Apache OpenOffice in May 2012. 119  Version history  edit  OpenOffice.org release history Version Release date Description Build 638c 2001-10 19  The first public milestone release. 1.0 2002-05-01 1  First official release. 1.0.3.1 2003-04 19  Last version officially supporting Windows  95. 1.1 2003-09-02 120  Export to PDF, export to Flash, extension mechanism. 102  1.1.1 2004-03-29 121  Bundled with TheOpenCD . 122  1.1.4 2004-12-22 120  Last version released under SISSL. 1.1.5 2005-09-09 120  Last release for 1.x product line.

OpenOffice.org 1  edit  OpenOffice.org 1.1 logo The preview, Milestone 638c, was released October 2001. 19  OpenOffice.org 1.0 was released under both the LGPL and the SISSL 23  for Windows, Linux and Solaris 136  on 1 May 2002. 1  137  The version for Mac OS X with X11 interface was released on 23 June 2003. 138  139  OpenOffice.org 1.1 introduced One-click Export to PDF and Export presentations to Flash .SWF. It also allowed third-party addons. 102  OpenOffice.org was used in 2005 by The Guardian to illustrate what it saw as the limitations of open-source software. 140  OpenOffice.org 2  edit  Work on version 2.0 began in early 2003 with the following goals the Q Product Concept better interoperability with Microsoft Office improved speed and lower memory usage greater scripting capabilities better integration, particularly with GNOME a more usable database digital signatures and improved usability . 141  It would also be the first version to default to OpenDocument. Sun released the first beta version on 4 March 2005. 142  On 2 September 2005, Sun announced that it was retiring SISSL to reduce license proliferation , 143  though some press analysts felt it was so that IBM could not reuse OpenOffice.org code without contributing back. 23  Versions after 2.0 beta 2 would use only the LGPL. 7  On 20 October 2005, OpenOffice.org 2.0 was released. 123  2.0.1 was released eight weeks later, fixing minor bugs and introducing new features. As of the 2.0.3 release, OpenOffice.org changed its release cycle from 18 months to releasing updates every three months. 144  The OpenOffice.org 2 series attracted considerable press attention. 145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  A PC Pro review awarded it 6 stars out of 6 and stated Our pick of the low-cost office suites has had a much-needed overhaul, and now battles Microsoft in terms of features, not just price. 153  Federal Computer Week listed OpenOffice.org as one of the 5 stars of open-source products, 154  noting in particular the importance of OpenDocument. ComputerWorld reported that for large government departments, migration to OpenOffice.org 2.0 cost one tenth of the price of upgrading to Microsoft Office 2007 . 155  OpenOffice.org 3  edit  The Sun Start Center for versions between 3.0 and 3.2.0 On 13 October 2008, version 3.0 was released, featuring the ability to import though not export Office Open XML documents, support for ODF 1.2, improved VBA macros , and a native interface port for OS X. It also introduced the new Start Center 131  and upgraded to LGPL version 3 as its license. 156  Version 3.2 included support for PostScript-based OpenType fonts. It warned users when ODF 1.2 Extended features had been used. An improvement to the document integrity check determined if an ODF document conformed to the ODF specification and offered a repair if necessary. Calc and Writer both reduced cold start time by 46 compared to version 3.0. 157  3.2.1 was the first Oracle release. 135  Version 3.3, the last Oracle version, was released in January 2011. 158  New features include an updated print form, a FindBar and interface improvements for Impress. 159  160  The commercial version, Oracle Open Office 3.3 StarOffice renamed, based on the beta, was released on 15 December 2010, as was the single release of Oracle Cloud Office a proprietary product from an unrelated codebase. 41  161  OpenOffice.org 3.4 Beta 1  edit  A beta version of OpenOffice.org 3.4 was released on 12 April 2011, including new SVG import, improved ODF 1.2 support, and spreadsheet functionality. 4  2  162  Before the final version of OpenOffice.org 3.4 could be released, Oracle cancelled its sponsorship of development 12  and fired the remaining Star Division development team. 34  58  Market share  edit  Problems arise in estimating the market share of OpenOffice.org because it could be freely distributed via download sites including mirror sites, peer-to-peer networks, CDs, Linux distributions and so forth. The project tried to capture key adoption data in a market-share analysis, 163  listing known distribution totals, known deployments and conversions and analyst statements and surveys. According to Valve Corporation , as of July 2010, 14.63 of Steam users had OpenOffice.org installed on their machines. 164  A market-share analysis conducted by a web analytics service in 2010, based on over 200,000 Internet users, showed a wide range of adoption in different countries 165  0.2 in China, 9 in the US and the UK and over 20 in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Germany. Although Microsoft Office retained 95 of the general market  as measured by revenue  as of August 2007, 166  OpenOffice.org and StarOffice had secured 1520 of the business market as of 2004 167  168  and a 2010 University of Colorado at Boulder study reported that OpenOffice.org had reached a point where it had an irreversible installed user base and that it would continue to grow. 169  The project claimed more than 98 million downloads as of September 2007 170  and 300 million total to the release of version 3.2 in February 2010. 171  The project claimed over one hundred million downloads for the OpenOffice.org 3 series within a year of release. 172  Notable users  edit  See also OpenDocument adoption Large-scale users of OpenOffice.org included Singapores Ministry of Defence , 173  and Banco do Brasil . 174  As of 2006 update  OpenOffice.org was the official office suite for the French Gendarmerie . 163  In India , several government organizations such as ESIC , IIT Bombay , National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development , the Supreme Court of India , ICICI Bank , 175  and the Allahabad High Court , 176  which use Linux, completely relied on OpenOffice.org for their administration. In Japan , conversions from Microsoft Office to OpenOffice.org included many municipal offices Sumoto, Hygo in 2004, 177  Ninomiya, Tochigi in 2006, 178  179  Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima in 2008 180  and to LibreOffice as of 2012 181  , Shikokuch, Ehime in 2009, 182  Minoh, Osaka in 2009 183  Toyokawa, Aichi , 184  Fukagawa, Hokkaido 185  and Katano, Osaka 186  in 2010 and Rygasaki, Ibaraki in 2011. 187  Corporate conversions included Assist in 2007 188  and to LibreOffice on Ubuntu in 2011 189  , Sumitomo Electric Industries in 2008 190  and to LibreOffice in 2012 191  , Toho Co., Ltd. in 2009 192  193  and Shinsei Financial Co., Ltd. in 2010. 194  Assist also provided support services for OpenOffice.org. 192  194  Retail  edit  In July 2007, Everex , a division of First International Computer and the 9th-largest PC supplier in the U.S., began shipping systems preloaded with OpenOffice.org 2.2 into Wal-Mart , K-mart and Sams Club outlets in North America. 195  Forks and derivative software  edit  A number of open source and proprietary products derive at least some code from OpenOffice.org, including AndrOpen Office, 196  Apache OpenOffice , ChinaOffice, Co-Create Office, EuroOffice 2005, 197  Go-oo , KaiOffice, IBM Lotus Symphony , IBM Workplace , Jambo OpenOffice the first office suite in Swahili , 198  199  200  LibreOffice , MagyarOffice, MultiMedia Office, MYOffice 2007, NeoOffice , NextOffice, OfficeOne, OfficeTLE, OOo4Kids, 201  OpenOfficePL, OpenOffice.org Portable, 202  OpenOfficeT7, OpenOffice.ux.pl, OxOffice, 203  OxygenOffice Professional, 204  205  Pladao Office, 206  PlusOffice Mac, 207  RedOffice, 37  130  208  RomanianOffice, StarOffice Oracle Open Office, SunShine Office, ThizOffice, UP Office, White Label Office, 209  210  211  212  WPS Office Storm the 2004 edition of Kingsoft Office  and 602Office. 213  The OpenOffice.org website also listed a large variety of complementary products, including groupware systems. 214  A timeline of major derivatives of StarOffice and OpenOffice.org     StarOffice    OpenOffice.org     Go-oo     IBM Workplace  IBM Lotus Symphony     NeoOffice     LibreOffice     Apache OpenOffice Major derivatives include Active  edit  Apache OpenOffice  edit  Main article Apache OpenOffice In June 2011, Oracle contributed the OpenOffice.org code and trademarks to the Apache Software Foundation. The developer pool for the Apache project was proposed to be seeded by IBM employees, Linux distribution companies and public sector agencies. 215  IBM employees did the majority of the development, 216  217  218  219  220  including hiring ex-Star Division developers. 218  The Apache project removed or replaced as much code as possible from OpenOffice.org 3.4 beta 1, including fonts, under licenses unacceptable to Apache 221  and released 3.4.0 in May 2012. 119  The codebase for IBMs Lotus Symphony was donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012 and merged for Apache OpenOffice 4.0, 222  and Symphony was deprecated in favour of Apache OpenOffice. 219  While the project considers itself the unbroken continuation of OpenOffice.org, 223  others regard it as a fork, 23  216  217  224  225  226  227  or at the least a separate project. 228  In October 2014, Bruce Byfield , writing for Linux Magazine , said the project had all but stalled possibly due to IBMs withdrawal from the project. 229  As of 2015 update  , the project has no release manager, 230  and itself reports a lack of volunteer involvement and code contributions. 231  After ongoing problems with unfixed security vulnerabilities from 2015 onward, 232  233  234  in September 2016 the project started discussions on possibly retiring AOO. 235  LibreOffice  edit  Main article LibreOffice Sun had stated in the original OpenOffice.org announcement in 2000 that the project would be run by a neutral foundation, 10  and put forward a more detailed proposal in 2001. 236  There were many calls to put this into effect over the ensuing years. 36  237  238  239  On 28 September 2010, in frustration at years of perceived neglect of the codebase and community by Sun and then Oracle, 69  members of the OpenOffice.org community announced a non-profit called The Document Foundation and a fork of OpenOffice.org named LibreOffice. Go-oo improvements were merged, and that project was retired in favour of LibreOffice. 240  The goal was to produce a vendor-independent office suite with ODF support and without any copyright assignment requirements. 241  Oracle was invited to become a member of the Document Foundation and was asked to donate the OpenOffice.org brand. 241  242  Oracle instead demanded that all members of the OpenOffice.org Community Council involved with the Document Foundation step down, 70  leaving the Council composed only of Oracle employees. 71  Most Linux distributions promptly replaced OpenOffice.org with LibreOffice 54  55  56  57  Oracle Linux 6 also features LibreOffice rather than OpenOffice.org or Apache OpenOffice. 243  244  245  The project rapidly accumulated developers, development effort 246  247  248  and added features, 249  the majority of outside OpenOffice.org developers having moved to LibreOffice. 44  45  48  In March 2015, an LWN.net development comparison of LibreOffice with Apache OpenOffice concluded that LibreOffice has won the battle for developer participation. 250  NeoOffice  edit  Main article NeoOffice NeoOffice , an independent commercial port for Macintosh that tracked the main line of development, offered a native OS X Aqua user interface before OpenOffice.org did. 251  Later versions are derived from Go-oo, rather than directly from OpenOffice.org. 252  All versions from NeoOffice 3.1.1 to NeoOffice 2015 were based on OpenOffice.org 3.1.1, though latter versions included stability fixes from LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice. 253  NeoOffice 2017 and later versions are fully based on LibreOffice. 254  Discontinued  edit  Go-oo  edit  Main article Go-oo The ooo-build patch set was started at Ximian in 2002, because Sun were slow to accept outside work on OpenOffice.org, even from corporate partners, and to make the build process easier on Linux. It tracked the main line of development and was not intended to constitute a fork. 255  Most Linux distributions used, 256  and worked together on, 257  ooo-build. Suns contributions to OpenOffice.org had been declining for a number of years 237  and some developers were unwilling to assign copyright in their work to Sun, 38  particularly given the deal between Sun and IBM to license the code outside the LGPL. 34  On 2 October 2007, Novell announced that ooo-build would be available as a software package called Go-oo, not merely a patch set. 258  The go-oo.org domain name had been in use by ooo-build as early as 2005. 259   Sun reacted negatively, with Simon Phipps of Sun terming it a hostile and competitive fork. 36  260  Many free software advocates worried that Go-oo was a Novell effort to incorporate Microsoft technologies, such as Office Open XML, that might be vulnerable to patent claims. 261  However, the office suite branded OpenOffice.org in most Linux distributions, having previously been ooo-build, soon in fact became Go-oo. 252  262  263  Go-oo also encouraged outside contributions, with rules similar to those later adopted for LibreOffice. 264  When LibreOffice forked, Go-oo was deprecated in favour of that project. OpenOffice Novell edition was a supported version of Go-oo. 265  IBM Lotus Symphony  edit  Main article IBM Lotus Symphony The Workplace Managed Client in IBM Workplace 2.6 23 January 2006 266   incorporated code from OpenOffice.org 1.1.4, 23  the last version under the SISSL. This code was broken out into a separate application as Lotus Symphony 30 May 2008 267  , with a new interface based on Eclipse . Symphony 3.0 21 October 2010 268   was rebased on OpenOffice.org 3.0, with the code licensed privately from Sun. IBMs changes were donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2012, Symphony was deprecated in favour of Apache OpenOffice 219  and its code was merged into Apache OpenOffice 4.0. 222  StarOffice  edit  Main article StarOffice Sun used OpenOffice.org as a base for its commercial proprietary StarOffice application software, which was OpenOffice.org with some added proprietary components. Oracle bought Sun in January 2010 and quickly renamed StarOffice as Oracle Open Office. 269  Oracle discontinued development in April 2011. 12  Free and open-source software portal Java programming language portal References  edit   a b c d e Lettice, John 1 May 2002.
