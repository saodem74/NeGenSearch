It is the work of Ken Thompson with Dennis Ritchie . B was derived from BCPL , and its name may be a contraction of BCPL. Thompsons coworker Dennis Ritchie speculated that the name might be based on Bon, an earlier, but unrelated, programming language that Thompson designed for use on Multics . note 1  B was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications, such as system and language software. 3  It was a typeless language, with the only data type being the underlying machines natural memory word format, whatever that might be. Depending on the context, the word was treated either as an integer or a memory address . As machines with ASCII processing became common, notably the DEC PDP-11 that arrived at Bell, support for character data stuffed in memory words became important. The typeless nature of the language was seen as a disadvantage, which led Thompson and Ritchie to develop an expanded version of the language supporting new internal and user-defined types, which became the C programming language . Contents 1 History 2 Examples 3 See also 4 Notes 5 References 6 External links History  edit  Circa 1969, Ken Thompson 2  and later Dennis Ritchie 3  developed B basing it mainly on the BCPL language Thompson used in the Multics project. B was essentially the BCPL system stripped of any component Thompson felt he could do without in order to make it fit within the memory capacity of the minicomputers of the time. The BCPL to B transition also included changes made to suit Thompsons preferences mostly along the lines of reducing the number of non-whitespace characters in a typical program. 2  Much of the typical ALGOL -like syntax of BCPL was rather heavily changed in this process. The assignment operator  reverted to the  of Rutishauser s Superplan the source of ALGOL 58 s  , and the equality operator  was replaced by  . Thompson invented arithmetic assignment operators for B, using x  y to add y to x in C the operator is written  . B also introduced the increment and decrement operators   and -- . Their prefix or postfix position determines whether the value is taken before or after alteration of the operand. These innovations were not in the earliest versions of B. According to Dennis Ritchie, people often assumed that they were created for the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes of the DEC PDP-11 , but this is historically impossible as the machine didnt exist when B was developed. 2  B is typeless, or more precisely has one data type the computer word. Most operators e.g.  , - ,  ,   treated this as an integer, but others treated it as a memory address to be dereferenced . In many other ways it looked a lot like an early version of C. There are a few library functions, including some that vaguely resemble functions from the standard IO library in C. 3  Early implementations were for the DEC PDP-7 and PDP-11 minicomputers using early Unix , and Honeywell GE 645 4  36-bit mainframes running the operating system GCOS . The earliest PDP-7 implementations compiled to threaded code , and Ritchie wrote a compiler using TMG which produced machine code. 5  6  7  In 1970 a PDP-11 was acquired and threaded code was used for the port an assembler, dc , and the B language itself were written in B to bootstrap the computer. An early version of yacc was produced with this PDP-11 configuration. Ritchie took over maintenance during this period. 2  7  The typeless nature of B made sense on the Honeywell, PDP-7 and many older computers, but was a problem on the PDP-11 because it was difficult to elegantly access the character data type that the PDP-11 and most modern computers fully support. Starting in 1971 Ritchie made changes to the language while converting its compiler to produce machine code, most notably adding data ty ping for variables. During 1971 and 1972 B evolved into New B NB and then C. 2  B is almost extinct, having been superseded by the C language . 8  However, it continues to see use on GCOS mainframes as of 2014 update   9  and on certain embedded systems as of 2000 update   for a variety of reasons limited hardware in small systems, extensive libraries, tooling, licensing cost issues, and simply being good enough for the job. 8  The highly influential AberMUD was originally written in B. Examples  edit  The following examples are from the Users Reference to B by Ken Thompson 3   The following function will print a non-negative number, n, to the base b, where 2 b 10.

Bon in turn was named either after his wife Bonnie or according to an encyclopedia quotation in its manual, after a religion whose rituals involve the murmuring of magic formulas. 2  References  edit   B - computer programming language . .mw-parser-output cite.citationfont-styleinherit.mw-parser-output .citation qquotes.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lock-green.svg9px-Lock-green.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation . cs1-lock-registration abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lock-gray-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLock-red-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-po sitionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registrationcolor555.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration spanborder-bottom1px dottedcursorhelp.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisource-logo.svg12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.pngno -repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output code.cs1-codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginherit.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-errordisplaynonefont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-errorfont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33margin-left0.3em.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-o utput .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-formatfont-size95.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-leftpadding-left0.2em.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-rightpadding-right0.2em  a b c d e f Ritchie, Dennis M.
