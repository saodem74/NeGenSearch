Examples are user guides, white papers, on-line help, quick-reference guides. It is becoming less common to see paper hard-copy documentation. Documentation is distributed via websites, software products, and other on-line applications. Professionals educated in this field are termed documentalists. This field changed its name to information science in 1968, but some uses of the term documentation still exists and there have been efforts to reintroduce the term documentation as a field of study.

In general, these may involve document drafting, formatting, submitting, reviewing, approving, distributing, reposting and tracking, etc., and are convened by associated SOPs in a regulatory industry. It could also involve creating content from scratch. Documentation should be easy to read and understand. If its too long and too wordy, it may be misunderstood or ignored. Clear, Short, Familiar words should be used to a maximum of 15 words to a sentence. Only gender hyper neutral word should be used and cultural biases should be avoided. Procedures should be numbered when they are to be performed. 11  , 12  , 13  , . 14  Producing documentation  edit  Technical writers and corporate communicators are professionals whose field and work is documentation. Ideally, technical writers have a background in both the subject matter and also in writing and managing content information architecture. Technical writers more commonly collaborate with subject matter experts SMEs, such as engineers, technical experts, medical professio nals, or other types of clients to define and then create content documentation that meets the users needs. Corporate communications includes other types of written documentation that is required for most companies. Specializing documentation  edit  Marketing Communications MarCom MarCom writers endeavor to convey the companys value proposition through a variety of print, electronic, and social media. This area of corporate writing is often engaged in responding to proposals. Technical Communication TechCom Technical writers document a companys product or service. Technical publication include user guides, installation and configuration manuals, and troubleshootingrepairreplace procedures. Legal Writing  This type of documentation is often prepared by attorneys or paralegals who could be in private practice or retained as corporate council.

SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION FOLDER SDF A common type of software document written by software engineers in the simulation industry is the SDF. When developing software for a simulator, which can range from embedded avionics devices to 3D terrain databases by way of full motion control systems, the engineer keeps a notebook detailing the development the build of the project or module. The document can be a wiki pag e, MS word document or other environment. They should contain a requirements section, an interface section to detail the communication interface of the software. Often a notes section is used to detail the proof of concept, and then track errors and enhancements. Finally, a testing section to document how the software was tested. This documents conformance to the clients requirements. The result is a detailed description of how the software is designed, how to build and install the software on the target device, and any known defects and work-arounds. This build document enables future developers and maintainers to come up to speed on the software in a timely manner, and also provides a roadmap to modifying code or searching for bugs. SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK INVENTORY AND CONFIGURATION  CMDB  These software tools can automatically collect data of your network equipment. The data could be for inventory and for configuration information. The ITIL Library requests to create such a database as a basis for all information for the IT responsible. Its also the basis for IT documentation. Examples include XIA Configuration 15  . Documentation in criminal justice  edit  Documentation is the preferred term for the process of populating criminal databases. Examples include the National Counter-terrorism Center s Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment TIDE, sex offender registries , and gang databases. 16  Documentation in Early Childhood Education  edit  Documentation, as it pertains to the Early Childhood Education field, is when we notice and value childrens ideas, thinking, questions, and theories about the world and then collect traces of their work drawings, photographs of the children in action, and transcripts of their words to share with a wider community 17  Thus, documentation is a process, used to link the educators knowledge and learning of the childchildren with the families, other collaborators, and even to the children themselves. Documentation is an integral part of the cycle of inquiry - observing, reflecting, documenting, sharing and responding. 17  Pedagogical documentation, in terms of the teacher documentation, is the teachers story of the movement in childrens understanding. 17  According to Stephanie Cox Suarez in Documentation - Transforming our Perspectives, teachers are considered researchers, and documentation is a research tool to support knowledge building among children and adults 18  Documentation can take many different styles in the classroom. The following exemplifies ways in which documentation can make the research, or learning, visible Documentation Panels bulletin-board-like presentation with multiple pictures and descriptions about the project or event. Daily Log a log kept every day that records the play and learning in the classroom Documentation developed by or with the children when observing children during documentation, the childs lens of the observation is used in the actual documentation Individual Portfolios documentation used to track and highlight the development of each child Electronic Documentation using apps and devices to share documentation with families and collaborators Transcripts or Recordings of Conversations using recording in documentation can bring about deeper reflections for both the educator and the child Learning Stories a narrative used to describe learning and help children see themselves as powerful learners 17   The Classroom as Documentation reflections and documentation of the physical environment of a classroom. 17  Documentation is certainly a process in and of itself, and it is also a process within the educator. The following is the development of documentation as it progresses for and in the educator themselves Develops habits of documentation Becomes comfortable with going public with recounting of activities Develops visual literacy skills Conceptualizes the purpose of documentation as making learning styles visible, and Shares visible theories for interpretation purposes and further design of curriculum. 19  See also  edit  Authoring Bibliographic control Change control Citation Index Copyright Description Document Documentation field Documentation science Document identifier Document management system Documentary Freedom of information Glossary Historical document Index publishing ISO 23841977 ISO 2591984 ISO 51231984 ISO 36021989 ISO 63571985 ISO 690 ISO 5964 ISO 9001 IEC 61355 International Standard Bibliographic Description Journal of Documentation Licensing Letterhead List of Contents Technical documentation User guide Medical certificate Publishing Records management Software documentation Style guide Technical communication Notes  edit  External links  edit  Look up documentation in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
