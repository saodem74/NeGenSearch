Mixed reality takes place not only in the physical world or the virtual world, but is a hybrid of reality and virtual reality , encompassing both augmented reality and augmented virtuality 2  via immersive technology . The first immersive mixed reality system, providing enveloping sight, sound, and touch was the Virtual Fixtures platform developed at the U.S. Air Forces Armstrong Laboratories in the early 1990s. In a study published in 1992, the Virtual Fixtures project at the U.S. Air Force demonstrated for the first time that human performance could be significantly amplified by the introduction of spatially registered virtual objects overlaid on top of a persons direct view of a real physical environment. 3  Contents 1 Virtual reality VR versus augmented reality AR versus mixed reality MR 2 Definition 2.1 Virtuality continuum and mediality continuum 2.2 Interreality physics 3 Augmented virtuality 4 Applications 4.1 IPCM  Interactive product content management 4.2 SBL  Simulation-based learning 4.3 Military training 4.4 Remote working 4.5 Functional mockup 4.6 Consciousness 4.7 Medical 5 Display technologies 6 Notable applications 7 See also 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links Virtual reality VR versus augmented reality AR versus mixed reality MR  edit  The reality-virtuality continuum The definitions in the modern contemporary economy distinguish between VR, AR, and MR Virtual reality VR immerses users in a fully artificial digital environment. Augmented reality AR overlays virtual objects on the real-world environment with spatial registration that enables geometric persistence concerning placement and orientation within the real world. Prior technologies that overlaid data or images not spatially registered to real-world geometries are referred to as heads-up display technologies. Mixed reality MR not just overlays, but anchors virtual objects to real-world objects and allows the user to interact with combined virtualreal objects. Definition  edit  Virtuality continuum and mediality continuum  edit  In 1994 Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino defined a mixed reality as ...anywhere between the extrema of the virtuality continuum  VC, 2  where the virtuality continuum extends from the completely real through to the completely virtual environment with augmented reality and augmented virtuality ranging between. The first fully immersive mixed reality system was the Virtual Fixtures platform developed at the United States Air Force s Armstrong Labs in 1992 by Louis Rosenberg to enable human users to control robots in real-world environments that included real physical objects and 3D virtual overlays called fixtures that were added enhance human performance of manipulation tasks. Published studies showed that by introducing virtual objects into the real world, significant performance increases could be achieved by human operators. 4  5  The continuum of mixed reality is one of the two axes in Steve Mann s concept of mediated reality as implemented by various welding helmets and wearable computers and wearable photographic systems he created in the 1970s and early 1980s, 6  7  8  9  10  the second axis being the mediality continuum , which includes, for example, Diminished Reality as implemented in a welding helmet or eyeglasses that can block out advertising or replace real-world ads with useful information 11  12  The conventionally held view of a Virtual Reality VR environment is one in which the participant-observer is immersed in, and able to interact with, a completely synthetic world. Such a world may mimic the properties of some real-world environments, either existing or fictional however, it can also exceed the bounds of physical reality by creating a world in which the physi cal laws ordinarily governing space, time, mechanics, material properties, etc. no longer hold. What may be overlooked in this view, however, is that the VR label is also frequently used in association with a variety of other environments, to which total immersion and complete synthesis do not necessarily pertain, but which fall somewhere along a virtuality continuum. In this p aper, we focus on a particular subclass of VR related technologies that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds, which we refer to generically as Mixed Reality MR. Virtuality axis left-to-right and medial axis bottom to top of the mediated reality continuum. Here four example points are shown augmented reality, augmented virtuality, mediated reality, and mediated virtuality on the virtuality and medial axes. This includes, for example, diminished reality e.g., computerized welding helmets that filter out and diminish certain parts of a scene Interreality physics  edit  In a physics context, the term interreality system 13  refers to a virtual reality system coupled to its real-world counterpart. A paper in the May 2007 issue of Physical Review E 14  describes an interreality system comprising a real physical pendulum coupled to a pendulum that only exists in virtual reality. This system has two stable states of motion a Dual Reality state in which the motion of the two pendula are uncorrelated and a Mixed Reality state in which the pendula exhibit stable phase-locked motion which is highly correlated. The use of th e terms mixed reality and interreality in the context of physics is clearly defined but may be slightly different in other fields. Augmented virtuality  edit  A person seen in a virtual environment with a camera acting as a third-person point of view 15  Augmented virtuality  AV , is a subcategory of mixed reality which refers to the merging of real-world objects into virtual worlds. 16  As an intermediate case in the virtuality continuum , it refers to predominantly virtual spaces, where physical elements, e.g., physical objects or people, are dynamically integrated into and can interact with, the virtual world in real time. This integration is achieved with the use of various techniques. Often streaming video from physical spaces e.g., via webcam 17  or using 3-dimensional digitalization of physical objects. 18  The use of real-world sensor information e.g., gyroscopes  to control a virtual environment is an additional form of augmented virtuality, in which external inputs provide context for the virtual view. Applications  edit  A topic of much research, MR has found its way into several applications, evident in the arts and entertainment industries. However, MR is also branching out into the business and education worlds with systems such as these IPCM  Interactive product content management  edit  Moving from static product catalogs to interactive 3D smart digital replicas. The solution consists of application software products with the scalable license model. SBL  Simulation-based learning  edit  Moving from e-learning to s-learningstate of the art in knowledge transfer for education. SimulationVR based training, interactive, experiential learning. Software and display solutions with scalable licensed curriculum development model. Military training  edit  Combat reality is simulated and represented in complex, layered data through HMD. One of the possible applications of mixed realities is for training military soldiers. Training solutions are often built on Commercial off-the-shelf COTS technologies. Examples of technologies used by the Army are Virtual Battlespace 3 and VirTra. As of 2018, the VirTra technology is being purchased by both the civilian and military law enforcement to train personnel in a variety of scenarios. These scenarios include active shooter domestic violence military traffic stops, etc. 19  20   Mixed reality technologies have been used by U.S. Army Research Laboratory scientists to study how this stress affects decision making. With mixed reality, researchers may safely study military service men and women in scenarios where soldiers would not likely survive. 21  As of 2017, the U.S. Army was developing the Synthetic Training Environment STE. STE is a collection of technologies for training purposes that has been estimated to include mixed reality. As of 2018, STE was still in development without a projected completion date. Some recorded goals of the simulation were to increase simulation training capabilities, and the availability o f the environment to other systems, and to enhance realism. 22  It was claimed that training costs to be reduced with mixed reality environments like STE. 23  24  For example, using mixed environments could reduce the amount of munition expended during training. 25  It was reported in 2018 that STE would include representation of any part of the worlds terrain for training purposes. 26  STE would offer a variety of training opportunities for squad brigade and combat teams, including, but not limited to Stryker , armory, and infantry. 27  It is estimated that STE will eventually replace the Armys Live, Virtual, Constructive  Integrated Architecture LVC-IA. 28  Remote working  edit  Mixed reality allows a global workforce of remote teams to work together and tackle an organizations business challenges. No matter where they are physically located, an employee can strap on their headset and noise-canceling headphones and enter a collaborative, immersive virtual environment. Language barriers will become irrelevant as AR applications can accurately translate in real time. It also means a more flexible workforce. While many employers still use inflexible models of fixed working time and location, there is evidence that employees are more productive if they have greater autonomy over where, when, and how they work. Some employees prefer loud workspaces others need silence. Some work best in the morning, others at night. Employees a lso benefit from autonomy in how they work because of everyone processes information differently. The classic model for learning styles differentiates between Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic learners. 29  Machine maintenance is also a subject that can be executed with the help of mixed reality. Larger companies that have multiple manufacturing locations with a lot of machinery can use mixed reality to educate and instruct their employee. The machines need regular checkups and have to be adjusted every now and then. These adjustments are mostly done by humans, so these employees need to be informed about every small adjustment that needs to be done. By using mixed reality, employees from multiple locations can put on a headset, and get live instructions about the changes. Instructors can operate the representation that every employee sees and can glide through the production area, zooming in to technical details and explain every change of a machine. I t has shown that a five-minute training session with such a mixed reality program has the same results as the employees reading a 50-page training manual. 30  Functional mockup  edit  Mixed reality is applied in the industrial field in order to build mock-ups that combine physical and digital elements. With the use of simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM, mock-ups can interact with the physical world to utilize features such as object permanence .  citation needed  Consciousness  edit  It has been hypothesized that a hybrid of mixed and virtual reality could pave the way for human consciousness to be transferred into digital form entirely  a concept known as Virternity , which would leverage blockchain to create its main platform. 31  32  Medical  edit  Mixed reality combines smart glasses with surgical processes. 33  Display technologies  edit  Here are some more commonly used MR display technologies Cave Automatic Virtual Environment Head-up display Head-mounted display Tablet PC Computer display Personal Digital Assistant Mobile phones Handheld PC Notable applications  edit  BAMZOOKi EyeToy FightBox Magic Leap Microsoft Hololens Nokia Point  Find ZSpace See also  edit  Blended space Extended reality Lifelike experience Mixed reality games Multimodal interaction Simulated reality Supranet Telexistence Viractualism Visuo-haptic mixed reality References  edit   R.
