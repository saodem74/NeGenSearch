A common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty . It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. The ambi - part of the term reflects an idea of  two , as in two meanings. The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness . In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted although some may not be immediately obvious, whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity. Context may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.

The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context -dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness . Linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law , because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance. Structural analysis of an ambiguous Spanish sentence Pepe vio a Pablo enfurecido Interpretation 1 When Pepe was angry, then he saw Pablo Interpretation 2 Pepe saw that Pablo was angry. Here, the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2. Lexical Ambiguity  edit  The lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. 2  Meaning here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word bank has several distinct lexical definitions, including  financial institution  and  edge of a river . Or consider  apothecary . One could say I bought herbs from the apothecary. This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary  pharmacist  or went to the apothecary  pharmacy . The context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says I buried 100 in the bank, most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word. Lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as word sense disambiguation . The use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used. The goal of clear concise communication is that the receivers have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politici an whose  weasel words  and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science . More problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. Good, for example, can mean useful or functional  Thats a good hammer , exemplary  Shes a good student , pleasing  This is good soup , moral  a good person versus the lesson to be learned from a story ,  righteous , etc.  I have a good daughter is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity unlockable can mean capable of being unlocked or impossible to lock. Semantic and syntactic ambiguity  edit  Semantic ambiguity occurs when a word, phrase or sentence, taken out of context, has more than one interpretation. In We saw her duck example due to Richard Nordquist, the words her duck can refer either to the persons bird the noun duck, modified by the possessive pronoun her, or to a motion she made the verb duck, the subject of which is the objective pronoun her, object of the verb saw. 3  Syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two or more different meanings because of the structure of the sentenceits syntax. This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. He ate the cookies on the couch, for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch as opposed to those that were on the table, or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies. To get in, you will need an entrance fee of 10 or your voucher and your drivers license. This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license. Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher. Only rewriting the sen tence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity. 3  For the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, formal languages such as computer programming languages , see Ambiguous grammar . Usually, semantic and syntactic ambiguity go hand in hand. The sentence We saw her duck is also syntactically ambiguous. Conversely, a sentence like He ate the cookies on the couch is also semantically ambiguous. Rarely, but occasionally, the different parsings of a syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning. For example, the command Cook, cook can be pars ed as Cook noun used as vocative, cook imperative verb form, but also as Cook imperative verb form, cook noun used as vocative. It is more common that a syntactically unambiguous phrase has a semantic ambiguity for example, the lexical ambiguity in Your boss is a funny man is purely semantic, leading to the response Funny ha-ha or funny peculiar Spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For example, ice cream and I scream. Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a mondegreen . Metonymy involves referring to one entity by the name of a different but closely related entity for example, using wheels to refer to a car, or Wall Street to refer to the stock exchanges located on that street or even the entire US financial sector. In the modern vocabulary of critical semiotics, metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on c ontextual contiguity located close together, or a function or process that an object performs, such as sweet ride to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humor. Philosophy  edit  Philosophers and other users of logic spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing or intentionally adding ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth, an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after taxes to convey the first sense or by changing which to that to convey the second sense or by rew riting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyones opinion. However, the opposite can also be true  an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity intentionally or not. The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equ ivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases. In continental philosophy particularly phenomenology and existentialism, there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. Martin Heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.3 In Heideggers phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Daseins sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work Being and Nothingness an essay in phenomenological ontology Jean-Paul Sartre follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. Simone de Beauvoir tries to base an ethics on Heideggers and Sartres writings The Ethics of Ambiguity, where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity as long as philosophers and they men have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment. Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting. Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to authoritatively disambiguate the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on dialectically integrating oppos ites and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity. Literature and rhetoric  edit  In literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool. Groucho Marxs classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, Ill never know. Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title Dont It Make My Brown Eyes Blue where blue can refer to the color, or to sadness. In the narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways motive, plot, character. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel The Great Gatsby . Mathematical notation  edit  Mathematical notation , widely used in physics and other sciences , avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several lexical , syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain. Names of functions  edit  The ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function , which can and should be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several special functions still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions Sinc function Elliptic integral of the third kind  translating elliptic integral form MAPLE to Mathematica , one should replace the second argument to its square, see TalkElliptic integralList of notations  dealing with complex values, this may cause problems. Exponential integral 4  Hermite polynomial 4   775 Expressions  edit  Ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts. It is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, f  f  x  displaystyle ffx . Then, if one sees f  f  y  1  displaystyle ffy1 , there is no way to distinguish whether it means f  f  x  displaystyle ffx multiplied by  y  1  displaystyle y1 , or function f displaystyle f evaluated at argument equal to  y  1  displaystyle y1 . In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning. Creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages  C and Fortran  require the character  as symbol of multiplication. The Wolfram Language used in Mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name identifier for different objects, for example, function and variable in particular, the expression ffx is qualified as an error. The order of operations may depend on the context. In most programming languages , the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, a  b c displaystyle abc is interpreted as a   b c  displaystyle abc  in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity. In the scientific journal style, one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions, whereas variables are written using italics. For example, in mathematical journals the expression s i n displaystyle sin does not denote the sine function , but the product of the three variables s displaystyle s , i displaystyle i , n displaystyle n , although in the informal notation of a slide presentation it may stand for sin displaystyle sin  . Commas in multi-component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted this is also potentially ambiguous notation. For example, in the notation T m n k displaystyle T_mnk , the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single-index object, taken with the subscript equal to product of variables m displaystyle m , n displaystyle n and k displaystyle k , or it is an indication to a trivalent tensor . Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions  edit  An expression such as sin 2    2 displaystyle sin 2alpha 2 can be understood to mean either  sin     2   2 displaystyle sinalpha 22 or  sin    2  2 displaystyle sin alpha 22 . Often the authors intention can be understood from the context, in cases where only one of the two makes sense, but an ambiguity like this should be avoided, for example by writing sin 2     2  displaystyle sin 2alpha 2 or 1 2 sin 2   textstyle frac 12sin 2alpha  . The expression sin  1   displaystyle sin -1alpha  means arcsin     displaystyle arcsinalpha  in several texts, though it might be thought to mean  sin     1 displaystyle sin alpha -1 , since sin n   displaystyle sin nalpha  commonly means  sin    n displaystyle sin alpha n . Conversely, sin 2   displaystyle sin 2alpha  might seem to mean sin   sin    displaystyle sinsin alpha  , as this exponentiation notation usually denotes function iteration  in general, f 2  x  displaystyle f2x means f  f  x   displaystyle ffx . However, for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions , this notation conventionally means exponentiation of the result of function application. The expression a  2 b displaystyle a2b can be interpreted as meaning  a  2  b displaystyle a2b , in particular if one thinks that the common acronym PEMDAS for the order of operations implies that Multiplication takes precedence over Division however, it is more commonly understood to mean a   2 b  displaystyle a2b . Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics  edit  It is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with        displaystyle alpha rangle  and states with fixed number of photons with    n    displaystyle nrangle  . Then, there is an unwritten rule the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and   n   displaystyle n photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if    x    displaystyle xrangle  is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and    p    displaystyle prangle  means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on quantum mechanics . Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized adimensional , dimensionless variables are used. Expression  1  displaystyle 1rangle  may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context. Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics  edit  Some physical quantities do not yet have established notations their value and sometimes even dimension , as in the case of the Einstein coefficients , depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like Ludwig Wittgenstein states in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus  ... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning. 5  A highly confusing term is gain . For example, the sentence the gain of a system should be doubled, without context, means close to nothing. It may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled. It may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled. It may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state. The term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of irradiance , luminous intensity , radiant intensity , or radiance , depending on the background of the person using the term. Also, confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant , or resolution of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise. See also Accuracy and precision and its talk. The Berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as definable or nameable. Terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal. 6  Mathematical interpretation of ambiguity  edit  The Necker cube and impossible cube , an underdetermined and overdetermined object, respectively. In mathematics and logic, ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of underdetermination for example, X  Y displaystyle XY leaves open what the value of X iswhile its opposite is a self-contradiction , also called inconsistency , paradoxicalness , or oxymoron , or in mathematics an inconsistent system such as X  2 , X  3 displaystyle X2,X3 , which has no solution. Logical ambiguity and self-contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects , such as the Necker cube and impossible cube, or many of the drawings of M. C. Escher . 7  Constructed language  edit  This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed .  September 2016   Learn how and when to remove this template message  Some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially lexical ambiguity . Lojban and Loglan are two related languages which have been created for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse source s contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn. Christianity and Judaism  edit  Christianity and Judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with ambiguity. Many Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Ottos description of the sacred as mysterium tremendum et fascinans, the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.  dubious  discuss  The orthodox Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases. The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox. Music  edit  In music , pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some polytonality , polymeter , other ambiguous meters or rhythms , and ambiguous phrasing , or Stein 2005, p.  79 any aspect of music . The music of Africa is often purposely ambiguous. To quote Sir Donald Francis Tovey 1935, p.  195, Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.

Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called multistable perception . The opposite of such ambiguous images are impossible objects . Pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance Computer science  edit  In computer science, the SI prefixes kilo- , mega- and giga- were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 1024, 1024 2 and 1024 3  contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion. This usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices e.g. DRAM  addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense. Subsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that binary prefixes could be written explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G unambiguous in texts conforming to the new standard  this led to a new ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes necessarily indicating the new style as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous old style or not new style. Note also that 1 M where M is ambiguously 1,000,000 or 1,048,576 is less uncertain than the engineering value 1.0e6 defined to designate the interval 950,000 to 1,050,000, and that as non-volatile storage devices began to commonly exceed 1 GB in capacity where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit, GB and TB almost always mean 10 9 and 10 12 bytes .
