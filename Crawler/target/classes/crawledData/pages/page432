Glossary of structural engineering From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Most of the terms listed in Wikipedia glossaries are already defined and explained within Wikipedia itself. However, glossaries like this one are useful for looking up, comparing and reviewing large numbers of terms together. You can help enhance this page by adding new terms or writing definitions for existing ones. This glossary of structural engineering terms pertains specifically to structural engineering and its sub-disciplines. Please see glossary of engineering for a broad overview of the major concepts of engineering. Contents    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z See also References A  edit  Abutment  refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam whereon the structures superstructure rests or contacts. 1  Acre  is a unit of land area used in the imperial and US customary systems. It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong 66 by 660 feet, which is exactly equal to 10 square chains ,  1  640 of a square mile, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047  m 2 , or about 40 of a hectare . Acrow prop  or BS prop is a piece of construction equipment. It is a telescopic tubular steel prop, used as a temporary support. A jackscrew is similar but not as long and not telescopic. Outside the UK an Acrow prop may be known as a jack post , adjustable post , telescoping prop or ... post , screw jack , adjustable steel column , adjustable steel prop or ... post , adjustable metal prop or ... post , as well as an adjustable shoring post or shore post . Adhesion  is the tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another  cohesion refers to the tendency of similar or identical particlessurfaces to cling to one another. The forces that cause adhesion and cohesion can be divided into several types. The intermolecular forces responsible for the function of various kinds of stickers and sticky tape fall into the categories of chemical adhesion, dispersive adhesion, and diffusive adhesion. In addition to t he cumulative magnitudes of these intermolecular forces, there are also certain emergent mechanical effects. Aggregate composite  is the component of a composite material that resists compressive stress and provides bulk to the composite material. For efficient filling, aggregate should be much smaller than the finished item, but have a wide variety of sizes. For example, the particles of stone used to make concrete typically include both sand and gravel . Aggregate construction  Construction aggregate is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction , including sand , gravel , crushed stone , slag , recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates. Air conditioning  often referred to as AC, AC, or air con 2  is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space to improve the comfort of occupants. Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. All-in ballast  Alloy is a combination of metals or of a metal and another element . Alloys are defined by a metallic bonding character. 3  An alloy may be a solid solution of metal elements a single phase or a mixture of metallic phases two or more solutions. Intermetallic compounds are alloys with a defined stoichiometry and crystal structure. Zintl phases are also sometimes considered alloys depending on bond types. American National Standards Institute  is a private non-profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States. 4  The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide. Annealing metallurgy  in metallurgy and materials science , is a heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness , making it more workable. It involves heating a material above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature for a suitable amount of time, and then cooling. ANSI  American National Standards Institute. Arch  is a vertical curved structure that spans an elevated space and may or may not support the weight above it, 5  or in case of a horizontal arch like an arch dam , the hydrostatic pressure against it. 6  Arching or compressive membrane action in reinforced concrete slabs  Architecture  is both the process and the product of planning , designing , and constructing buildings or any other structures . 7  Architectural works, in the material form of buildings , are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art . Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. Architectural engineering  Architrave  also called an epistyle  is the lintel or beam that rests on the capitals of the columns . It is an architectural element in Classical architecture . The term can also be applied to all sides, including the vertical members, of a frame with mouldings around a door or window. The word architrave is also used to refer more generally to a style of mouldings or other elements framing the top of a door, window or other rectangular opening, where the horizontal head casing extends across the tops of the vertical side casings where the elements join creating a butt joint , as opposed to a miter joint . 8  Ashlar  is finely dressed cut, worked stone, either an individual stone that has been worked until squared or the structure built of it. Ashlar is the finest stone masonry unit, generally cuboid , mentioned by Vitruvius as opus isodomum , or less frequently trapezoidal . Precisely cut on all faces adjacent to those of other stones, ashlar is capable of very thin joints between blocks, and the visible face of the stone may be quarry-faced or feature a variety of treatments tooled, smoothly polished or rendered with another material for decorative effect. 9  10  Austenitization  means to heat the iron, iron-based metal, or steel to a temperature at which it changes crystal structure from ferrite to austenite. 11  The more open structure of the austenite is then able to absorb carbon from the iron-carbides in carbon steel. An incomplete initial austenitization can leave undissolved carbides in the matrix. 12  For some iron metals, iron-based metals, and steels, the presence of carbides may occur during the austenitization step. The term commonly used for this is two-phase austenitization . 13  Contents    Top 09 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z See also References External links B  edit  Ballast  is material that is used to provide stability to a vehicle or structure. Ballast, other than cargo , may be placed in a vehicle, often a ship or the gondola of a balloon or airship , to provide stability . Barrier cable  is a vehicular or pedestrian restraint system. It consists of a steel strand which is similar to the strand used in post-tensioned concrete . Beam  is a structural element that primarily resists loads applied laterally to the beams axis. Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending . The loads applied to the beam result in reaction forces at the beams support points. The total effect of all the forces acting on the beam is to produce shear forces and bending moments within the beam, that in turn induce internal stresses, strains and deflections of the beam. Beams are characterized by their manner of support, profile shape of cross-section, length, and their material. Bearing capacity  is the capacity of soil to support the loads applied to the ground. The bearing capacity of soil is the maximum average contact pressure between the foundation and the soil which should not produce shear failure in the soil. Ultimate bearing capacity is the theoretical maximum pressure which can be supported without failure allowable bearing capacity is the ultimate bearing capacity divided by a factor of safety . Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring in such cases, the allowable bearing capacity is based on the maximum allowable settlement. There are three modes of failure that limit bearing capacity general shear failure, local shear failure, and punching shear failure. Bending  In applied mechanics , bending, also known as flexure, characterizes the behavior of a slender structural element subjected to an external load applied perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the element. Bending moment  is the reaction induced in a structural element when an external force or moment is applied to the element causing the element to bend . 14  15  Benefitcost analysis  Costbenefit analysis CBA, sometimes called benefit costs analysis BCA, is a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives used to determine options which provide the best approach to achieving benefits while preserving savings for example, in transactions, activities, and functional business requirements. 16  A CBA may be used to compare completed or potential courses of actions, or to estimate or evaluate the value against the cost of a decision, project, or policy. It is commonly used in commercial transactions, business or policy decisions particularly public policy , and project investments. Bent structural  Bents are the building blocks that define the overall shape and character of a structure. They do not have any sort of pre-defined configuration in the way that a Pratt truss does. Rather, bents are simply cross-sectional templates of structural members, i.e., rafters, joists, posts, pilings, etc., that repeat on parallel planes along the length of the structure. The term bent is not restricted to any particular material. Bents may be formed of wooden piles, timber framing, 17  steel framing, or even concrete. 18  Bistable structure  Brick  is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay , but it is now used to denote rectangular units made of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime , or concrete materials. Bricks can be joined together using mortar , adhesives or by interlocking them. 19  20  Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are fired and non-fired bricks.

Alternative names are aluminous cement, high-alumina cement and Ciment fondu in French. They are used in a number of small-scale, specialized applications. Camber beam  In building, a camber beam is a piece of timber cut archwise, and steel bent or rolled, with an obtuse angle in the middle, commonly used in platforms, as church leads, and other occasions where long and strong beams are required. The camber curve is ideally a parabola but practically a circle segment as even with modern materials and calculations, cambers are imprecise. 22  Castellated beam  is a beam style where an I-beam is subjected to a longitudinal cut along its web following a specific pattern in order to divide it, and reassemble the beam with a deeper web by taking advantage of the cutting pattern. 23  Cant  Cantilever  Cantlop Bridge  Carbon steel  Cast iron  Casting  Catenary  Cavity wall  Cement  Cement render  Collar beam  Color-tagged structure  Column  Common rafter  Compensation  Composite order  Compressive strength  Computer-aided design  Computer-aided engineering  Concrete  Concrete masonry unit  Concrete pump  Construction aggregate  Construction engineering  Construction surveying  Corbel  Corinthian order  Corrosion  Corrosion fatigue  Corrugated galvanised iron  Crane  Cross brace  Cross bracing  Curvilinear motion  Contents    Top 09 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z See also References External links D  edit  Dam  is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams.
