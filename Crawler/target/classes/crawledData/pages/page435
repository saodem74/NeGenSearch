This new template has more possibilities to give a more detailled view on the field. At the moment some of the parts needs some more work, as always. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  2015, 20 October 2008 UTC I disagree that it should replace that template. That template is about a multidisciplinary process that includes software engineering but is not summed up by software engineering. Software engineering describes a skill that evolves much faster than any one process. You are doing both software engineers and those who work with software engineers a disservice by trying to monopo lize all the software development terminology under the umbrella of software engineering. Oicumayberight  talk  0304, 21 October 2008 UTC I have responded on the TalkSoftware engineering here -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1258, 21 October 2008 UTC You can try to oversimplify it by saying that software engineering is the main discipline. Im sure there are product developers and project managers that would disagree with you, but thats beside the point. The point is that software development is multidisciplinary. Youre trying to pull the disciplines of software development that have little to do with engineering under the umbrella of software engineering as if those functions are a less important subclass of engineering. The article and the template are titled software development process, not software engineering process. You are just in denial that development is broader in scope than engineering. Oicumayberight  talk  0010, 22 October 2008 UTC I have responded on the TalkSoftware engineering here -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  0954, 22 October 2008 UTC The other template was better because it laid it out in steps and was highly visible at the top for those who may have only been interested in a particular step. I know that software engineering is not a step-by-step process, so I think its futile to have software engineering template replace the software development process template. There should be two separate templates, on e for the broader software development process and the other for the field or skill of software engineering. Your oversimplifying both subjects by merging the templates. Oicumayberight  talk  2238, 22 October 2008 UTC I have responded on the TalkSoftware engineering here -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  2346, 22 October 2008 UTC The listing of notable software engineers  edit  I am working on the listing of notable software engineers. I am using the following criterea for selection People who developed software development models and methods And not People known for the writting of software engineering bestsellers allthough better known the list should focuss on pioneers People who developed new programming languages. I think that is an other field but I could be wrong. There was a list of developers of program languages in the History of software engineering article, see here  John Backus , inventor of Fortran . Alan Cooper , developer of Visual Basic . Edsger Dijkstra , developed the framework for proper programming. James Gosling developer of Oak , the precursor of Java  Anders Hejlsberg , developer of Turbo Pascal . Bill Joy , inventor of vi , early author of BSD Unix, and originator of SunOS , which became Solaris . Alan Kay , pioneering work on object-oriented programming, and originator of Smalltalk . Brian Kernighan , co-author of the first book on the C programming language with Dennis Ritchie , coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages. John Von Neumann , originator of the operating system concept. Dennis Ritchie , inventor of C . Bjarne Stroustrup , developer of C . Ken Thompson , inventor of Unix . Niklaus Wirth inventor of Pascal and Modula . Now I already moved this list to the History of programming languages article, which I think is an other field of computer science. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1950, 24 October 2008 UTC New listing proposals  edit  24 October 2008 I like to add the following scientists Ward Cunningham born 1949 is the American computer programmer who developed the first wiki. A pioneer in both design patterns and Extreme Programming , he started programming the software WikiWikiWeb in 1994. Edward Yourdon born 1944 is a computer consultant, an author and lecturer, and a recognized pioneer in the software engineering methodology of structured programming with Larry Constantine  Michael A. Jackson born 1936 is an British computer scientist, who developed the Jackson Structured Programming in the 1970s and Jackson System Development in the 1980s. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1950, 24 October 2008 UTC I have added these three software engineers. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1244, 27 October 2008 UTC 28 October 2008 I like to add the following software engineers Winston W. Royce , the first to present the waterfall model in 1970. Article created today. James Martin author , who has written has written extensively on his computer systems design methodology. His article need some work though. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  2316, 27 October 2008 UTC I have added these two people. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  0031, 30 October 2008 UTC 30 October 2008  edit  Barry Boehm , Boehm also created the spiral model of software development Tom DeMarco is an author, teacher, and speaker on software engineering topics. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  0019, 30 October 2008 UTC Software engineering methodsmethodologies  edit  The Topic outline of software engineering is listing the following 16 Software engineering methodsmethodologies. I have put these in a historical order Flowcharting since 1920 1970s Structured programming since 1969 Jackson Structured Programming since 1975 1980s Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology SSADM from 1980 onwards Information Engineering IEIEM since 1981 1990s Object-oriented programming OOP evolved since the early 1990s Virtual finite state machine VFSM since 1990s Dynamic Systems Development Method developed in the UK in the 1990s. Scrum development, since the late 1990s New millennium Extreme Programming since 1999 Enterprise Unified Process EUP an RUP extension since 2002 Rational Unified Process RUP since 2003. Constructionist design methodology CDM since 2004 by Kristinn R. Thrisson Agile Unified Process AUP since 2005 by Scott Ambler Method concepts Top-down programming  evolved in the 1970s by IBM researcher Harlan Mills and Niklaus Wirth  in developed structured programming . Praxis Now this list seems rather incomplete to me. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  2050, 24 October 2008 UTC Unified Process  edit  The Unified Process article lists some more methods, all refimentrefinements and variations of the Unified Process framework. 3 of 8 already listed above Agile, Enterprise and Rational Agile Unified Process AUP, a lightweight variation developed by Scott W. Ambler Basic Unified Process BUP, a lightweight variation developed by IBM and a precursor to OpenUP Enterprise Unified Process EUP, an extension of the Rational Unified Process Essential Unified Process EssUP, a lightweight variation developed by Ivar Jacobson Open Unified Process OpenUP, the Eclipse Process Framework software development process Rational Unified Process RUP, the IBM  Rational Software development process Oracle Unified Method OUM, the Oracle development and implementation process Rational Unified Process-System Engineering RUP-SE, a version of RUP tailored by Rational Software for System Engineering -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1516, 25 October 2008 UTC I do think there should be a separate software development methodology again, explaining the basic charateristics of those methodologies and list the different types in the field of software enginering. As a start I started a CategorySoftware development methodology in Wikicommons. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1249, 27 October 2008 UTC Prominent people in the history of Programming languages versus Software Engineering  edit  Today three names have been added to the template and I have removed two of them Bertrand Meyer , known as developer of the Eiffel programming language Martin Fowler , author and famous speaker on software architecture, who has written five popular books on the topic of software development in the 1980s Douglas McIlroy , a famous programmer. Now I wonder how these persons relate to other prominent people in the history of programming languages such as John Backus , inventor of Fortran . Alan Cooper , developer of Visual Basic . Edsger Dijkstra , developed the framework for proper programming. James Gosling developer of Oak , the precursor of Java  Anders Hejlsberg , developer of Turbo Pascal . Bill Joy , inventor of vi , early author of BSD Unix, and originator of SunOS , which became Solaris . Alan Kay , pioneering work on object-oriented programming, and originator of Smalltalk . Brian Kernighan , co-author of the first book on the C programming language with Dennis Ritchie , coauthor of the AWK and AMPL programming languages. John Von Neumann , originator of the operating system concept. Dennis Ritchie , inventor of C . Bjarne Stroustrup , developer of C . Ken Thompson , inventor of Unix . Niklaus Wirth inventor of Pascal and Modula . Now I have started a similar discussion about this on the talk page of the History of software engineering article, see here . I personnaly consider the development of programming languages an other field of computer science than software engineering. Now I have moved the above list of prominent people from the history of software engineering to the History of programming languages . Now I do think Bertrand Meyer are Douglas McIlroy famous computer scientists, but I dont see them as software engineers. That is why I will remove the from the template. I am not so sure about Martin Fowler either, and if beeing a notable author is enough to be listed in the template. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1702, 11 November 2008 UTC Bertrand Meyer created the Design by Contract methodology, which is an important contribution to Software Engineering. He is not known just by the creation of the Eiffel programming language. Douglas McIlroy created the concept of reusable software modules see his seminal paper in the 1st Software Engineering conference, sponsored by NATO and also invented the pipes-and-filters connections in UNIX, which was an advance in Software Architecture and in Programming-in-the-Large. So both should appear in the list. As to Martin Fowler , he is a popularizer of Software Engineering advances . I do not know what contributions he has given to the state of the art in Software Engineering. So the inclusion of his name would probably be somewhat harder to defend, if we are willing to include only people who have advanced the frontiers of the field. -- Antonielly  talk  1712, 11 November 2008 UTC Niklaus Wirth should also be in the list. He invented a Software Engineering methodology named Stepwise Refinement . The list is also missing other important inclusions such as David Parnas , the inventor of information hiding . Mark C. Paulk , the SEI guy who is behind the CMMI creation effort, and Paul Clements  Rick Kazman , the SEI guys who invented the ATAM , should also be included. And lets not forget Frank DeRemer and Hans Kron , who invented the important notion of Programming in the large , the basis of the software architecture activity. -- Antonielly  talk  1734, 11 November 2008 UTC Thanks. I guess we could readd Bertrand Meyer and Niklaus Wirth . This is no exact science. The bounderies of Software engineering are vague, but I like to keep the developers of programming tools separate. I think the contributions of Douglas McIlroy and David Parnas are more in that field ...just as the contributions of the even more notable computer scientists mentioned above. I am no real expert in this field, so I am open for suggestions. I do have been developing the Wikipedia representation of systems engineering, and have experienced that this field like software engineering is a very specific field with its own names. Now I just started this template, and I know there is a lot to improve here and this will take time. I dont agree on one of your other choices. The template is not just a listing of notable software engineers. They should have an Wikpedia article and I prefer a longer Wikipedia article, explaining their work in relation to Software engineering. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  2258, 11 November 2008 UTC Alright, since we have reached consensus in the inclusion of Bertrand Meyer and Niklaus Wirth , Ill readd them. However, Douglas McIlroy and David Parnas cannot be left out since they are two of the founders of Software Engineering, and active participants of the first Software Engineering conference ever, sponsored by NATO. They are not just tool developers they have made important contributions to establish the conceptual framework of the field. Some Douglas McIlroys contributions the notions of mass-produced software components 1 and of assembling software components read The Roots of Software Engineering , and the foundation of Component-based software engineering . Some David Parnas contributions the information hiding principle which is a software design concept, not an executable software tool to help localization of volatile changeable design assumptions the notion of modular design in software development 2 . He is also one of the fathers of Software architecture and of Software Product Line Engineering 3 . The Wikipedia article about him list of some awards he has won due to his Software Engineering contributions. See also a selected collection of his influential papers in Software Engineering . I am also going to add to the template the names Watts Humphrey a founder of CMUs Software Engineering Institute , contributor to the ideas of software engineering process improvement and measurement of software quality , development of the Capability Maturity Model , Personal Software Process and Team Software Process , Philippe Kruchten developer of the 41 view model and a long-time head of the IBM Rational Unified Process . If you disagree with those, please write here in the talk page. But please tell whether you are now convinced that the names Douglas McIlroy and David Parnas merit the inclusion. By the way, I completely agree with you that an important contribution to Computer science or to the Programming language field does not automatically qualify as an important contribution to Software Engineering a related but different field. I share with you the intention of only adding to the template the names of remarkable Software Engineering contributors andor practitioners. -- Antonielly  talk  0958, 27 November 2008 UTC I will study the presents of Charles Bachman some more, and get back on this. Now removing Tim Berners-Lee doesnt make much sense to me either. He seems to be generaly considered a software engineer, see for example here  Designed by the British software engineer TIM BERNERS-LEE 1955- the web is a democratic medium which is equally available to us all. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1117, 30 November 2008 UTC Tim Berners-Lee was removed from the template because the Wikipedia article about him does not mention any direct, relevant contribution to Software Engineering. The Web is an important application, but not a direct contribution explicitly made to advance or popularize the Software Engineering field it is neither a software development techniques book nor a new methodology, for instance. There seems to be a consensus here in the talk page that tool creators should be left out of the template. Otherwise, we should also add names such as Dan Bricklin , the creator of VisiCalc , and Dennis Ritchie  Ken Thompson , the original developers of UNIX . I believe we do not want that. In my opinion, we should include in the Software Engineers section only the subset of software engineers who are notable for their Software Engineering contributions, not software engineers who arent notable for their Software Engineering contributions but who used Software Engineering techniques to create important applications. -- Antonielly  talk  1222, 30 November 2008 UTC I agree on most point you mentioned here I quess you are right about Tim Berners-Lee . I agree we should only list the subset of software engineers, who are notable for their Software Engineering contributions. I also agree you removed Tom Gruber . I do think some of the new articles you added needs some improvement Now I do think the number of people mentioned in the template should be limited to say the current 20 to 25 names. Otherwise the template is growing to large. We can list all people of the CategorySoftware engineering and or CategorySoftware engineering researchers. We have to make a choice. And indeed some people have to be removed again. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1407, 30 November 2008 UTC Underlying question of the SE boundaries  edit  I think there is an underlaying question of where are the boundaries of software engineering Which are its main subjects How did this field develope And which subjects could be considered related to related fields And which are the related fields of software engineering. These are questions, I think, which should have to be answered in the software engineering article. In the above discussion I think some related fields have been mentioned now Data base, data base design and Data base management. The web and Web applications Programming and tool creatings Ontology I just noticed Carlo Ghezziother 2003 in Fundamentals of Software Engineering 2nd Edition page 8-12 names the following five SE related areas of computer science Programming languages Operating Systems Data bases Artificial Intelligence, and Theoretical models This seems like a good start for a new section in the Software engineering article. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1427, 30 November 2008 UTC Wikipedia article traffic statistics  edit  A listing of the popularity of some of the subjects listed in the template, see here Software engineering topics  edit  Agile software development has been viewed 114630 times in 200811 ranked 1600 Unified Modeling Language has been viewed 106837 times in 200811 ranked 2762 Service-oriented architecture has been viewed 103486 times in 200811 ranked 1984 Software testing has been viewed 90855 times in 200811 ranked 2250 Object-oriented programming has been viewed 80742 times in 200811 ranked 6455 Systems Development Life Cycle has been viewed 74424 times in 200811 ranked 5537 Software engineering has been viewed 61037 times in 200811 ranked 5937 Scrum development has been viewed 60410 times in 200811. ranked 6570 Software development process has been viewed 60019 times in 200811 Computer programming has been viewed 54609 times in 200811 7256 Waterfall model has been viewed 54910 times in 200811.

I noticed it seems to make sense to add some of the frequently viewed articles not yet listed. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  2116, 30 November 2008 UTC I separated the related field section. I noticed this section couldshould be more specific. It doesnt seem to make sense to add mathematics and management as related fields. I think this couldshould be more specified. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  2137, 30 November 2008 UTC Software engineers listed  edit  Charles Bachman  edit  What were the contributions of Charles Bachman to Software engineering  He seems to be a very remarkable contributor to the field of Databases , but I do not know of his notable contributions to Software engineering . If there arent any, his name should be removed from this template and added to the Database template, if it exists. -- Antonielly  talk  1114, 30 November 2008 UTC The Wikipedia article about Tom Gruber does not mention any contribution to the Software Engineering field. Web Engineering, AI, ontologies and Semantic Web are not Software Engineering subjects. Therefore, his name should not appear in this template until contributions to Software Engineering are mentioned in the article about him. I have removed from the template the names Charles Bachman and Tom Gruber . Those names can be readded if someone finds important Software Engineering contributions from them and mentions such contributions on the articles of the respective researchers. While this does not happen, those names should be left out of this template. -- Antonielly  talk  1237, 30 November 2008 UTC I agree. See my previous comment. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1411, 30 November 2008 UTC Douglas McIlroy  edit  I removed Douglas McIlroy , because I think almost nothing in his current Wikipedia article justifies his listing here. I do think this article should be improved first, before relisting. I think this also counts for some other articles listed. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1439, 30 November 2008 UTC Philippe Kruchten  edit  I removed Philippe Kruchten as well because, his current article doesnt explain his existence here. Also the 41 view model doesnt seem that important to Software engineering. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1445, 30 November 2008 UTC Mohamed Fayad  edit  User Pnahar added Mohamed Fayad to this list. Is this appropriate Possible COI noted on TalkMohamed Fayad . -- Instantquail  talk  1939, 1 May 2016 UTC Software Engineering awards  edit  I miss articles about the main Software Engineering awards. After they are created in Wikipedia, they should be mentioned in the Prizes section of the template. Some external links SIGSOFT Awards ICSEs Most Influential Paper Award A list of various Software Engineering and SE-related Awards -- Antonielly  talk  1301, 30 November 2008 UTC I removed this section here, and added it to the Software engineer article. At the moment this section hardly gives any information and links to other Wikipedia articles. The three items listed are stubs, and I oppose the listing of stubs in any wikipedia article. Now I have removed some other names as well, and we had some previous discussion. Maybe I have to explain these actions some more. I think this template shouldnt reflect the general status of the field of software engineering. I should focuss on the Wikipedia representation of this field. It is a summary of the main things Wikipedia has to offer. Back to this subject. I have been developing some other templates as well and I cant recall ever seen engineering awards being added in other templates. There are other ways to bring this to the peoples attention, see for example the Turing award template. -- Marcel Douwe Dekker  talk  1912, 30 November 2008 UTC Where is the Chaos Model  edit  Is it not officially recognized as a canonical development modelstrategy If not, sad, cause there is no equal to be found in these dusty old white-paper meet-the-deadline-and-not-much-else standards from the days of punch-cards and vacuum tubes. Preceding unsigned comment added by 67.98.176.66  talk  1636, 11 January 2011 UTC New criteria for inclusion  edit  The recent add of Stephen J. Mellor in the template has made me wonder about the criteria for inclusion. I checked Google Scholar and found that Mellor is quiet a highly cited author. This made me wonder about the other persons listed in template, and I did some more checking with Google Scholar. Google scholar listed the following number of citations of the three best-cited articles Author Number of citations Number of citations Number of citations Kent Beck 7248 4542 1493 Grady Booch 8902 6040 5097 Fred Brooks 3360 3381 288 Barry Boehm 7001 4072 1652 Peter Chen 7713 2544 2389 Ward Cunningham 1198 894 562 Ole-Johan Dahl 1259 852 747 Tom DeMarco 3067 376 383 Martin Fowler 4542 3864 1820 C.A.R. Hoare 14969 4760 1926 Watts Humphrey 3023 1420 574 Michael A. Jackson 1192 1270 1158 Ivar Jacobson 8902 5532 5097 James Martin 3026 2013 1447 Stephen J. Mellor 865 827 797 Bertrand Meyer 7756 1744 1803 David Parnas 4513 868 853 Winston W. Royce 2467 529 18 James Rumbaugh 9038 8902 5097 Niklaus Wirth 1439 1385 1368 Edward Yourdon 2937 1693 982 Victor Basili 2201 1215 1126 I guess this table shows there is some reason to doubt the inclusion of Stephen J. Mellor . -- Mdd  talk  2013, 29 November 2012 UTC A new light on this matter occurs, when we take in account some of the authors who have been excluded, for example Author Number of citations Number of citations Number of citations Larry Constantine 1693 1053 905 Philippe Kruchten 3483 1917 347 Craig Larman 2175 606 401 Douglas McIlroy 1117 272 153 John F. Sowa 4248 2869 855 John Zachman 2140 855 363 Some of those authors have higher numbers, but they are not all to be considered software engineers especially Sowa en Zachman. -- Mdd  talk  2016, 30 November 2012 UTC This is good stuff Mdd I didnt realize that Stephen Mellor is also an Agile Manifesto Signatory, which adds to his importance. Your table above bolsters the arguement to add Phillipe Krutchen with his contributions in Software Architecture and RUP.
