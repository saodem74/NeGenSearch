This is the pronunciation key for IPA transcriptions of English on Wikipedia. It provides a set of symbols to represent the pronunciation of English in Wikipedia articles, and example words that illustrate the sounds that correspond to them. Integrity must be maintained between the key and the transcriptions that link here. Changes should reflect consensus  especially if the conventions of this key are already in wide use, any substantive change to it should be discussed on the talk page first so as not to create discrepancies between the key and transcriptions. .mw-parser-output .module-shortcutboxplainfloatrightborder1px solid aaabackgroundfffmargin0 0 0 1empadding0.3em 0.6em 0.2em 0.6emtext-aligncenterfont-size85font-weightbold.mw-parser-output .module-shortcutlistdisplayinline-blockborder-bottom1px solid aaamargin-bottom0.2emfont-weightnormal.mw-parser-output .module-shortcutanchordivpositionrelative top-3em.mw-parser-output li .module-shortcutanchordivfloatright Shortcuts HIPA-EN HIPAE HIPAEN Throughout Wikipedia, the pronunciation of words is indicated by means of the International Phonetic Alphabet  IPA . The following tables list the IPA symbols used for English words and pronunciations. Please note that several of these symbols are used in ways that are specific to Wikipedia and differ from those used by dictionaries. If the IPA symbols are not displayed properly by your browser, see the links below .

Words in SMALL CAPITALS are the standard lexical sets . Words in the lexical sets BATH and CLOTH may be given two transcriptions, the former either with  or  , the latter with  or  . The length mark    does not mean that the vowels transcribed with it are always longer than those without it. When unstressed, followed by a voiceless consonant, or in a polysyllabic word, a vowel in the former group is frequently shorter than the latter in other environments see Clipping phonetics   English . Dialect variation Further information English phonology and International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects This key represents diaphonemes , abstractions of speech sounds that accommodate General American , Received Pronunciation RP and to a large extent also Australian , Canadian , Irish including Ulster , New Zealand , Scottish , South African and Welsh pronunciations. Therefore, not all of the distinctions shown here are relevant to a particular dialect Many speakers of American and Canadian English pronounce cot kt and caught kt the same. k  You may simply ignore the difference between the symbols  and  , just as you ignore the distinction between the written vowels o and au when pronouncing them. Some speakers from Northern England do not distinguish the vowel of square skwr and nurse nrs . l  If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols r and r . In New Zealand English, the vowels of kit kt and foc u s foks have the same schwa -like quality. m  n  If you are from New Zealand, ignore the difference between the symbols  and  . In contemporary New Zealand English and some other dialects, the vowels of near nr and square skwr are not distinguished. o  If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols r and r . In Scottish English and Ulster English , the vowels of foot ft and goose us are not distinguished. p  q  If you speak either of those dialects, ignore the difference between the symbols  and u . In Northern England English, the vowels of foot ft and strut strt are not distinguished. r  If you are from Northern England, ignore the difference between the symbols  and  . In Welsh English and some other dialects, the vowels of u northodoxy nrdksi and a n orthodoxy n rdksi are not distinguished. s  If you speak such a dialect, ignore the difference between the symbols  and  . Depending on the dialect, vowels can be subject to various mergers before l , so that e.g. fill fl and feel fil or pull pl and pool pul may not be distinguished. See English-language vowel changes before historic l for more information. In many dialects, r occurs only before a vowel if you speak such a dialect, simply ignore r in the pronunciation guides where you would not pronounce it, as in cart krt . In other dialects, j  y es cannot occur after t, d, n , etc., within the same syllable if you speak such a dialect, then ignore the j in transcriptions such as new nju . For example, New York is transcribed nju jrk . For most people from England and for some New Yorkers, the r in jrk is not pronounced for most people from the United States, including some New Yorkers, the j in nju is not pronounced and may be ignored. See yod-dropping . On the other hand, there are some distinctions which you might make but which this key does not encode, as they are seldom reflected in the dictionaries used as sources for Wikipedia articles The vowels of kit and bit , distinguished in South Africa. t  Both of them are transcribed as  in stressed syllables and as  or  in unstressed syllables. The difference between the vowels of fir , fur and fern , maintained in some Scottish and Irish English but lost elsewhere. u  All of them are transcribed as r . The vowels of north and force , distinguished in Scottish English, Irish English and by a minority of American speakers. u  Both of them are transcribed as r . The vowels of pause and paws , distinguished in Cockney and by some Estuary English speakers. v  Both of them are transcribed as  or r , depending on the word. The vowels of bad and lad , distinguished in many parts of Australia . Both of them are transcribed as  . The vowels of manning and Manning , distinguished in some parts of the United States see  raising . Both of them are transcribed as  . The difference between the vowels of pain and pane found in some English, Welsh, and Newfoundland dialects. Both of them are transcribed as e . The difference between the vowels of holy and wholly found in Cockney and many Estuary English speakers. w  Both of them are transcribed as o . The vowels of spider and spied her , distinguished in many parts of Scotland. x  Both of them are transcribed as a . The vowels of rider and writer , distinguished in many parts of Canada and some parts of the United States. Both of them are transcribed as a . The vowels of powder and pouter distinguished in many parts of Canada and some parts of the United States. Both of them are transcribed as a . Other words may have different vowels depending on the speaker. The pronunciation of the  vowel in most dialects of Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales has always been closer to  a  . BBC English has moved away from the traditional near-open front realization    towards almost fully open front realization  a  , and both the Oxford English Dictionary and the 2014 edition of Gimsons Pronunciation of English transcribe the vowel in lad , bad , cat , trap with a . y  For more extensive information on dialect variations, you may wish to see the IPA chart for English dialects . Note that place names are not generally exempted from being transcribed in this abstracted system, so rules such as the above must be applied in order to recover the local pronunciation. Examples include place names in much of England ending ford , which although locally pronounced  fd are transcribed  frd . This is best practice for editors. However, readers should be aware that not all editors may have followed this consistently, so for example if  fd is encountered for such a place name, it should not be interpreted as a claim that the r would be absent even in a rhotic dialect. Other transcriptions If you feel it is necessary to add a pronunciation respelling using another convention, then please use the conventions of Wikipedias pronunciation respelling key .

HelpIPAConventions for English HelpPronunciation respelling key Pronunciation respelling for English Notes  a b In varieties with flapping , t and sometimes also d between a vowel and a weak or word-initial vowel may be pronounced with a voiced tap    , making latter sound similar or identical to ladder . Some dictionaries transcribe t subject to this process as  d  or  t , but they are not distinguished in this transcription system. In those varieties, the sequence nt in the same environment as in winter  may also be realized as a nasalized tap    , which may sound similar or identical to n . This is also not distinguished in this system.  a b c d e f g In dialects with yod dropping , j in ju or jr is not pronounced after coronal consonants  t , d , s , z , n ,  , and l  in the same syllable, so that dew dju is pronounced the same as do du . In dialects with yod coalescence , tj and dj mostly merge with t and d , so that the first syllable in Tuesday is pronounced the same as choose . In some dialects sj and zj are also affected and frequently merge with  and  . Where j in ju or jr following a coronal is still pronounced in yod-dropping accents, place a syllable break before it menu mn.ju .  The phoneme hw is not distinguished from w in the many dialects with the wine  whine merger , such as RP and most varieties of General American. For more information on this sound, see voiceless labialized velar approximant .  The IPA value of the letter  j  may be counterintuitive to English speakers, but the spelling is found even in some common English words like hallelujah and fjord .  l in the syllable coda , as in the words all , cold , or bottle , is pronounced as  o  ,  u  ,  w  or a similar sound in many dialects through L-vocalization .  In most varieties of English, r is pronounced as an approximant  . Although the IPA symbol  r  represents a trill ,  r  is widely used instead of    in broad transcriptions of English.  A number of English words, such as genre and garage , may be pronounced with either  or d .  In most dialects, x can also be replaced by k in most words, including loch . It is also replaced with h in some words, particularly of Yiddish origin, such as Chanukah .  a b ,  are only found in French loanwords and often replaced by another vowel and a nasal consonant bon vivant bn vivnt , ensemble nsmbl , etc. a    is only found in loanwords in British and Southern Hemisphere accents, and therefore a transcription that includes it must always be prefaced with a label indicating the variety of English. Use this when a reliable source shows that a vowel in a loanword is pronounced as  in these accents and as a different vowel in General American. If a reliable source shows that a vowel is pronounced as the NURSE vowel in General American as well even though spelled without r , as in Goethe and hors doeuvre , use r .  In non-rhotic accents like RP, r is not pronounced unless followed by a vowel.  In dialects with the father  bother merger such as General American,  is not distinguished from  .  In most of the United States, r is merged with r , except for a handful of words such as borrow , tomorrow and sorry , which are realized with r . In some parts of the Southern and Northeastern US, it is always merged with r . In Canada, it is always merged with r .  In North America,  is often pronounced like a diphthong e before nasal consonants and, in some particular regional dialects, other environments. See  raising .  a b c r , r and r are not distinguished in many North American accents  Mary  marry  merry merger . Some speakers merge only two of the sounds most typically r with one of the short vowels and less than a fifth of speakers of American English make a full three-way distinction, like RP and similar accents. b   a b In much of North America, a or a may have a slightly different quality when it precedes a voiceless consonant, as in price or mouth , from that in ridepie or loudhow , a phenomenon known as Canadian raising . Since this occurs in a predictable fashion, it is not distinguished in this transcription system.  a b c In some dialects, especially in the UK, the second segment in a diphthong followed by  is often omitted. This process or lack thereof may help choose between ar, ar, r in some words  diary, admirer  and ar, ar, r in others  pirate, siren , a distinction not always clear.  a b c d Some speakers pronounce higher, flower, mayor and coyer more coy with two syllables, and hire, flour, mare and coir with one. Others pronounce them the same.   is transcribed as  e  by many dictionaries. c  However, e is also sometimes transcribed as  e , especially in American literature, so    is chosen here.  a b c  ,  , or  may be separated from r only when a stress follows it. The IPAc-en template supports r , r , r , r , r , and r as distinct diaphonemes for such occasions.  a b c d  and o may be strong or weak depending on context. d  Whether an instance of unstressed  is strong or weak may not be clear in some circumstances. e   a b Words like idea, real, theatre , and cruel may be pronounced with  or  in non-rhotic accents such as Received Pronunciation, and some dictionaries transcribe them with ,  , f  but since they do not stem from historical r and are not pronounced with r in rhotic accents, they should be transcribed with i, u , not with ,  , in this transcription system.  o is transcribed with    for Received Pronunciation.   is not distinguished from  in dialects with the cot  caught merger such as Scottish English, Canadian English and many varieties of General American. In North America, the two vowels most often fall together with  .  Some conservative dialects make a distinction between the vowels in horse and hoarse , but the number of speakers who make this distinction any longer is very small and many dictionaries do not differentiate between them  horse  hoarse merger . The vowel in hoarse was formerly represented as r on Wikipedia, but is now represented as r , identical to horse .  r is not distinguished from r in dialects with the cure  force merger , including many younger speakers. In England, the merger may not be fully consistent and may only apply to more common words. In conservative RP and Northern England English r is much more commonly preserved than in modern RP and Southern England English. In Australia and New Zealand, r does not exist as a separate phoneme and is replaced either by the sequence ur  ur before vowels within the same word, save for some compounds or the monophthong r .  Some, particularly American, dictionaries notate  with the same symbol as  , which is found only in unstressed syllables, and distinguish it from  by marking the syllable as stressed. Also note that although   , the IPA symbol for the open-mid back vowel , is used, the typical modern pronunciation is rather close to the near-open central vowel  in both Received Pronunciation and General American.   is not used in the dialects of the northern half of England, some bordering parts of Wales, and some broad eastern Ireland accents. These words would take the  vowel there is no foot  strut split .  In Received Pronunciation, r is pronounced as a lengthened schwa,  . In General American, it is phonetically identical to r . Some dictionaries therefore use  , r  instead of the conventional notations  , r . When  r  is used for r , it is distinguished from r by marking the syllable as stressed. Word-initially, r never occurs, giving way to r . Where there is a free variation between r and r in RP, it is acceptable to transcribe only the more common variant e.g. r for persona .  r is not distinguished from r in dialects with the hurry  furry merger such as General American.  a b In a number of contexts,  in r , l , n , or m is often omitted, resulting in a syllable with no vowel. Some dictionaries show  in those contexts in parentheses, superscript, or italics to indicate this possibility, or simply omit  . When followed by a weak vowel, the syllable may be lost altogether, with the consonant moving to the next syllable, so that doubling db.l. may alternatively be pronounced as db.l , and Edinburgh d.n.br. as d.n.br . j  When not followed by a vowel, r merges with  in non-rhotic accents.  In accents with the weak vowel merger such as most Australian and American accents,  in unstressed positions is not distinguished from  , making rabbit and abbot rhyme and Lenin and Lennon homophonous. Pairs like roses and Rosas are kept distinct in American accents because of the difference in morphological structure, g  but may be homophonous in Australian. h  In these accents, unstressed l, n, m merge with l, n, m , so that Latin rhymes with baton and cabinet may be disyllabic see the previous note.  a b o and u in unstressed, prevocalic positions are transcribed as w by Merriam-Webster, but no other dictionary uniformly follows this practice. i  Hence a difference between w in Merriam-Webster and o or u in another source is most likely one in notation, not in pronunciation, so w in such cases may be better replaced with o or u accordingly, to minimize confusion stwen  stuen , flwr  flor .  a b  i  represents variation between i and  in unstressed positions. It is realized with a quality closer to i in accents with happy tensing , such as Australian English, General American, and modern RP, and to  in others.  u  likewise represents variation between u and  , but is restricted to not only unstressed but prevocalic positions.  The sequence  i  may be pronounced as two syllables, i. or . , or as one, j or  . When pronounced as one syllable in a non-rhotic accent, it may be indistinguishable from, and identified as, the NEAR vowel  r . f  This transcription system uses  i , not  i. ,   , etc., to cover all these possibilities.  The sequence  u  may be pronounced as two syllables, u. or . , or as one, w or  . When pronounced as one syllable in a non-rhotic accent, it may be indistinguishable from, and identified as, the CURE vowel  r . f  This transcription system uses  u , not  u. ,   , etc., to cover all these possibilities.  Syllable divisions are not usually marked, but the IPA dot  .  may be used when it is wished to make explicit where a division between syllables is or may be made. References  Jones 2011 .
