She is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering NAE. Prof. Leveson conducts research on the topics of system safety, software safety, software and system engineering, and human-computer interaction. In 1999, she received the ACM Allen Newell Award for outstanding computer science research and in 1995 the AIAA Information Systems Award for developing the field of software safety and for promoting responsible software and system engineering practices where life and property are at stake. In 2005 she received the ACM Sigsoft Outstanding Research Award. She has published over 200 research papers and is author of two books, Safeware System Safety and Computers published in 1995 by A ddison-Wesley and Engineering a Safer World published in 2012 by MIT Press. She consults extensively in many industries on the ways to prevent accidents. Books  edit  Erik Hollnagel, David D. Woods, Nancy Leveson, Resilience Engineering Concepts and Precepts .
