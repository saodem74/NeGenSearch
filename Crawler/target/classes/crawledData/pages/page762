UNIVAC From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This article is about the corporate organizations that built the UNIVAC lines of mainframe computers. For the original UNIVAC computer, see UNIVAC I . UNIVAC  Universal Automatic Computer  is a line of electronic digital stored-program computers starting with the products of the EckertMauchly Computer Corporation . Later the name was applied to a division of the Remington Rand company and successor organizations. The BINAC , built by the EckertMauchly Computer Corporation, was the first general-purpose computer for commercial use. The descendants of the later UNIVAC 1107 continue today as products of the Unisys company.

Presper Eckert and John Mauchly built the ENIAC Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer at the University of Pennsylvania s Moore School of Electrical Engineering between 1943 and 1946. A 1946 patent rights dispute with the university led Eckert and Mauchly to depart the Moore School to form the Electronic Control Company, later renamed Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation EMCC, based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . That company first built a computer called BINAC BINary Automatic Computer for Northrop Aviation which was little used, or perhaps not at all. Afterwards began the development of UNIVAC. UNIVAC was first intended for the Bureau of the Census , which paid for much of the development, and then was put in production. With the death of EMCCs chairman and chief financial backer Harry L. Straus in a plane crash on October 25, 1949, EMCC was sold to typewriter maker Remington Rand on February 15, 1950. Eckert and Mauchly now reported to Leslie Groves , the retired army general who had managed the Manhattan Project . The most famous UNIVAC product was the UNIVAC I mainframe computer of 1951, which became known for predicting the outcome of the U.S. presidential election the following year. This incident is noteworthy because the computer predicted an Eisenhower landslide when traditional pollsters all called it for Adlai Stevenson . 1  The numbers were so skewed that CBS s news boss in New York, Mickelson, decided the computer was in error and refused to allow the prediction to be read. Instead they showed some staged theatrics that suggested the computer was not responsive, and announced it was predicting 8-7 odds for an Eisenhower win the actual prediction was 100-1. When the predictions proved true and Eisenhower won a landslide within 1 of the initial prediction, Charles Collingwood , the on-air announcer, embarrassingly announced that they had covered up the earlier prediction. 2  The United States Army requested a UNIVAC computer from Congress in 1951. Colonel Wade Heavey explained to the Senate subcommittee that the national mobilization planning involved multiple industries and agencies This is a tremendous calculating process...there are equations that can not be solved by hand or by electrically operated computing machines because they involve millions of relationships that would take a lifetime to figure out. Heavey told the subcommittee it was needed to help with mobilization and other issues similar to the invasion of Normandy that were based on the relationships of various groups. 3  Remington Rand had its own calculating machine lab in Norwalk, Connecticut , and later bought Engineering Research Associates ERA in St. Paul, Minnesota . In 1953 or 1954 Remington Rand merged their Norwalk tabulating machine division, the ERA scientific computer division, and the UNIVAC business computer division into a single division under the UNIVAC name. This severely annoyed those who had been with ERA and with the Norwalk laboratory. In 1955 Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand. The UNIVAC division of Remington Rand was renamed the Univac division of Sperry Rand. General Douglas MacArthur was chosen to head the company. In the 1960s, UNIVAC was one of the eight major American computer companies in an industry then referred to as  IBM and the seven dwarfs   a play on Snow White and the seven dwarfs, with IBM, by far the largest, being cast as Snow White and the other seven as being dwarfs Burroughs , Univac, NCR , CDC , GE , RCA and Honeywell . 4  In the 1970s, after GE sold its computer business to Honeywell and RCA sold its to Univac, the analogy to the seven dwarfs became less apt and the remaining small firms became known as the  BUNCH   B urroughs, U nivac, N CR, C ontrol Data, and H oneywell. To assist corporate identity the name was changed to Sperry Univac, along with Sperry Remington, Sperry New Holland , etc. In 1978, Sperry Rand, a conglomerate of various divisions computers, typewriters, office furniture, hay balers, manure spreaders, gyroscopes, avionics, radar, electric razors, decided to concentrate solely on its computing interests and all of the unrelated divisions were sold. The company dropped the Rand from its title and reverted to Sperry Corporation. In 1986, Sperry Corporation merged with Burroughs Corporation to become Unisys . Since the 1986 merger of Burroughs and Sperry, Unisys has evolved from a computer manufacturer to a computer services and outsourcing firm, competing in the same marketplace as IBM , Electronic Data Systems EDS, and Computer Sciences Corporation . Unisys continues to design and manufacture enterprise class computers with the ClearPath and ES7000 server lines. 5  Models  edit  Main article List of UNIVAC products UNIVAC II UNIVAC 1103 UNIVAC 1232 Control panel for UNIVAC 1232 UNIVAC 110080 UNIVAC 1108 UNIVAC Console Printer In the course of its history, UNIVAC produced a number of separate model ranges. Early UNIVAC 1100 series models were vacuum tube computers. The original model range was the UNIVAC I UNIVersal Automatic Computer I, the second commercial computer made in the United States. 6  The main memory consisted of tanks of liquid mercury implementing delay line memory , arranged in 1000 words of 12 alphanumeric characters each. The first machine was delivered on 31 March 1951. The UNIVAC II was an improvement to the UNIVAC I that UNIVAC first delivered in 1958. The improvements included magnetic non-mercury core memory of 2000 to 10000 words, UNISERVO II tape drives which could use either the old UNIVAC I metal tapes or the new PET film tapes, and some circuits that were transistorized although it was still a vacuum tube computer. It was fully compatible with existing UNIVAC I programs for both code and data. The UNIVAC II also added some instructions to the UNIVAC Is instruction set. Sperry Rand began shipment of UNIVAC III in 1962, and produced 96 UNIVAC III systems. Unlike the UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II, it was a binary machine as well as maintaining support for all UNIVAC I and UNIVAC II decimal and alphanumeric data formats for backward compatibility. This was the last of the original UNIVAC machines. The UNIVAC Solid State was a 2-address, decimal computer, with memory on a rotating drum with 5000 signed 10 digit words, aimed at the general purpose business market. It came in two versions the Solid State 80 IBM-Hollerith 80 column cards and the Solid State 90 Remington-Rand 90 column cards. This computer used magnetic amplifiers , not transistors, because the transistors then available had highly variable characteristics and were not sufficiently reliable. The magnetic amplifiers were based on tiny magnetic cores with two wire windings. The magnetic amplifiers required powerful pulses of heavy current produced by a transmitter-type vacuum-tube, of a type still used in amateur radio final amplifiers. Thus the Solid State depended, at the heart of its operations, on a vacuum tube. The UNIVAC 11002200 series is a series of compatible 36-bit transistorized computer systems initially made by Sperry Rand. The series continues to be supported today by Unisys Corporation as the ClearPath Forward Dorado Series. 7  Remington Rand 409 was a control panel programmed punched card calculator, designed in 1949. The UNIVAC 418 aka 1219 was an 18-bit word core memory machine. Over the three different models, more than 392 systems were manufactured. The UNIVAC 490 was a 30-bit word core memory machine with 16K or 32K words 4.8 microsecond cycle time. The UNIVAC 1232 was a military version of the 490. 8  The UNIVAC 492 is similar to the UNIVAC 490 , but with extended memory to 64K 30-bit words. The UNIVAC 494 was a 30-bit word machine and successor to the UNIVAC 490492 with faster CPU and 131K later 262K core memory. Up to 24 IO channels were available and the system was usually shipped with UNIVAC FH880 or UNIVAC FH432 or FH1782 magnetic drum storage. Basic operating system was OMEGA successor to REX for the 490 although custom operating systems were also used e.g. CONTORTS for airline reservations. The UNIVAC 1004 was a plug-board programmed punched card data processing system, introduced in 1962 by UNIVAC. Total memory was 961 characters 6 bits of core memory . Peripherals were a card reader 400 cardsminute, a card punch 200 cardsminute using proprietary 90-column, round-hole cards or IBM-compatible, 80-column cards, a drum printer 400 linesminute and a Uniservo tape drive. The 1004 was also supported as a remote card reader  printer via synchronous communication services. A U.S. Navy Weapons Station, Concord 1004 was dedicated to printing from tape as a means of offloading the task from their Solid State 80 mainframe, which produced the tapes. A plug-board program called Emulator was widely installed to convert 1004s to stored-program operation, reading in instructions from program decks of cards which determined the processing of the following data decks. Once installed, Emulator was rarely removed as it could run the machine as desired and, as almost every machine function was used, it was physically heavy from the sheer mass of installed jumpers filling nearly the entire board. Emulator was not a Univac product, rather it was built by each customer, a tedious task. Its heavy use of the 1004s program-branching reed relays, called selectors, caused increased failures, later solved by the use of electronic selectors in the follow-on 1005. The UNIVAC 1005 , an enhanced version of the UNIVAC 1004, was introduced in February 1966. The main improvement over the 1004 was conversion from the plug-board program to an internal stored program . The machine saw extensive use by the US Army , including the first use of an electronic computer on the battlefield. Additional peripherals were also available including a paper tape reader and a three pocket stacker selectable card readpunch. The machine had a two-stage assembler SAAL - Single Address Assembly Language which was its primary assembler it also had a three-stage card based compiler for a programming language called SARGE. 1005s were used as some nodes on Autodin . The UNIVAC 1050 was an internally programmed computer with up to 32K of six-bit character memory, which was introduced in 1963. It was a one-address machine with 30-bit instructions, had a 4K operating system and was programmed in the PAL assembly language. The 1050 was used extensively by the U.S. Air Force supply system for inventory control. The UNIVAC 9000 series 9200, 9300, 9400, 9700 was introduced in the mid-1960s to compete with the low end of the IBM 360 series. The 9200 and 9300, which differed in CPU speed and maximum memory capacity 16K for the original 9200 vs 32K for the other variants implemented the same 16-bit modified subset of the 360 architecture as the Model 20 , while the UNIVAC 9400 implemented a subset of the full 360 instruction set. This didnt violate IBM patents or copyrights Sperry got the rights to clone the 360 as settlement of a lawsuit concerning IBMs infringement of Remington Rands core memory patents. The 9400 was roughly equivalent to the IBM 36030. The 9000 series used plated wire memory , which functioned somewhat like core memory but used a non-destructive read. Since the 9000 series was intended as direct competitors to IBM, they used 80-column cards and EBCDIC character encoding. Memory capacity started as low as 8K byte primary storage for a batch-configured system. Optionally a disk drive subsystem could be added, with 8414 5MB disk drives as well as tape drives, using the Uniservo VI. The UNIVAC Series 90  High-end 9060, 9070, 9080 The high-end Series 90 machines were successors to the high-end UNIVAC 9000 machines, but added virtual memory and thus were similar, or equivalent, to later IBM System370 mainframes. Low-end 9030, 9025, 9040 Separately from the high-end series, Sperry Univac introduced the Univac 9030 in about 1975 to provide an upgrade path for 9x00 users and to compete with IBMs System 3 . It used a disk operating system and had either a 300 or 600 lines per minute printer, a card reader, optionally a card punch, a console Uniscope 100, attached disk drives that had removable disk packs, several 1600 or 6250 BpI tape drives, and an optional communications controller supporting up to 16 terminals later 32 The standard disk drive was the 8416 which held a multi-layer platter removable disk pack that held approximately 29 million bytes. The 8418 drive was an enhanced version that supported both 29MB and double-density 58MB disk packs. These disk drives operated on the IDA Integrated Disk Adapter. There was also an optional 8430 drive with a 100MB capacity that operated on a separate high speed selector channel. Available tape drives were the Uniser vo 10 Mux Channel and Uniservo 14 Selector channel. The optional Selector Channel also enabled the use of other high speed devices such as the 1200 lpm 0776 printer or the 2000 lpm 0770 printer. The machine had either 4K or 16K memory chips, and typical machines had between 128 to 512 KiB memory. It ran an OS called OS3, and could run up to 7 jobs at one time, not counting various OS extensions such as the print spooler and telecommunications access ICAM. It was an upgrade path for users who had outgrown the IBM System3. It ran Cobol-74, RPG2, Fortran, and Assembler. The instruction set of the 90xx series was implemented in microcode and was loaded into control storage as part of the boot up process, before loading the operating system. Shortly after the 9030 was introduced, Sperry Univac introduced the 9025 which was the same basic hardware, however had an option for a smaller 80 column card reader and was a bit slower. The machine executed 3 instructions and then a NOP no op to slow it down, as nearly every component was identical to the 9030. Later a 9040 model was added, with improved performance from a faster clock rate cycle time of 500ns vs 600ns, pre-fetching of the next instruction , and greater maximum main memory capacity 1M vs 512K. The Sperry UNIVAC System 80 series  The entire 90xx series was eventually replaced in 1981 by the System 80, a Sperry-badged, IBM360-like mainframe actually developed and engineered by Mitsubishi in Japan. Operating systems  edit  The 1107 was the first 36-bit, word-oriented machine with an architecture close to that which came to be known as that of the  1100 Series . It ran the EXEC I or EXEC II operating system, batch-oriented second-generation operating systems , typical of the early to mid-1960s. The 1108 ran EXEC II or EXEC 8 . EXEC 8 allowed simultaneous handling of real-time applications, time-sharing , and background batch work. Transaction Interface Package TIP, a transaction-processing environment, allowed programs to be written in COBOL whereas similar programs on competing systems were written in assembly language. On later systems, EXEC 8 was renamed OS 1100 and OS 2200 , with modern descendants maintaining backwards compatibility. Some more exotic operating systems ran on the 1108one of which was RTOS, a more bare-bones system designed to take better advantage of the hardware. The affordable System 80 series of small mainframes ran the OS3 operating system which originated on the Univac 9030 and later 9025, and 9040. The UNIVAC Series 90 first ran with Univac developed OS9, which was later replaced by RCAs Virtual Memory Operating System VMOS. RCA originally called this operating system Time Sharing Operating System TSOS, running on RCAs Spectra 70 line of virtual memory systems and changed its name to VMOS before the Sperry acquisition of RCA CSD. After VMOS was ported to the 9060, Univac renamed it VS9 .
