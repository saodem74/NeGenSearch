Business processes occur at all organizational levels and may or may not be visible to the customers. 1  2  3  A business process may often be visualized modeled as a flowchart of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process. 2  3  4  5  The benefits of using business processes include improved customer satisfaction and improved agility for reacting to rapid market change. 1  2  Process-oriented organizations break down the barriers of structural departments and try to avoid functional silos . 6  Contents 1 Overview 2 History 2.1 Adam Smith 2.2 Frederick Winslow Taylor 2.3 Peter Drucker 2.4 Other definitions 3 Related concepts 3.1 Workflow 3.2 Business process re-engineering 3.3 Business process management BPM 3.4 Knowledge management 3.5 Total quality management 3.6 Information technology as an enabler for business process management 4 Importance of the process chain 5 Policies, processes and procedures 6 Reporting as an essential base for execution 7 Supporting theories and concepts 7.1 Span of control 7.2 Information management concepts 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading Overview  edit  A business process begins with a mission objective an external event and ends with achievement of the business objective of providing a result that provides customer value. Additionally, a process may be divided into subprocesses process decomposition, the particular inner functions of the process. Business processes may also have a process owner, a responsible party for en suring the process runs smoothly from start to finish. 2  Broadly speaking, business processes can be organized into three types, according to von Rosing et al. 6  Operational processes, which constitute the core business and create the primary value stream, e.g., taking orders from customers, opening an account, and manufacturing a component Management processes , the processes that oversee operational processes, including corporate governance , budgetary oversight, and employee oversight Supporting processes, which support the core operational processes, e.g., accounting , recruitment , call center , technical support , and safety training A slightly different approach to these three types is offered by Kirchmer 2  Operational processes, which focus on properly executing the operational tasks of an entity this is where personnel get the things done Management processes, which ensure that the operational processes are conducted appropriately this is where managers ensure efficient and effective work processes Governance processes, which ensure the entity is operating in full compliance with necessary legal regulations, guidelines, and shareholder expectations this is where executives ensure the rules and guidelines for business success are followed A complex business process may be decomposed into several subprocesses, which have their own attributes but also contribute to achieving the overall goal of the business. The analysis of business processes typically includes the mapping or modeling of processes and sub-processes down to activitytask level. Processes can be modeled through a large number of methods and techniqu es. For instance, the Business Process Modeling Notation is a business process modeling technique that can be used for drawing business processes in a visualized workflow . 1  2  4  6  While decomposing processes into process types and categories can be useful, care must be taken in doing so as there may be crossover. In the end, all processes are part of a largely unified outcome, one of customer value creation. 6  This goal is expedited with business process management, which aims to analyze, improve, and enact business processes. 2  History  edit  Adam Smith  edit  An important early 1776 description of processes was that of economist Adam Smith in his famous example of a pin factory. Inspired by an article in Diderots Encyclopdie , Smith described the production of a pin in the following way 7  One man draws out the wire another straights it a third cuts it a fourth points it a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head to make the head requires two or three distinct operations to put it on is a peculiar business to whiten the pins is another ... and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operatio ns, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. Smith also first recognized how the output could be increased through the use of labor division . Previously, in a society where production was dominated by handcrafted goods , one man would perform all the activities required during the production process, while Smith described how the work was divided into a set of simple tasks, which would be performed by specialized workers. 3  The result of labor division in Smiths example resulted in productivity increasing by 24,000 percent sic, i.e. that the same number of workers made 240 times as many pins as they had been producing before the introduction of labor division. 7  It is worth noting that Smith did not advocate labor division at any price and per se . The appropriate level of task division was defined through experimental design of the production process. In contrast to Smiths view which was limited to the same functional domain and comprised activities that are in direct sequence in the manufacturing process, 7  todays process concept includes cross-functionality as an important characteristic. Following his ideas, the division of labor was adopted widely, while the integration of tasks into a functional, or cross-functional, process was not considered as an alternative option until much later. 8  Frederick Winslow Taylor  edit  American engineer, Frederick Winslow Taylor greatly influenced and improved the quality of industrial processes in the early twentieth century. His Principles of Scientific Management focused on standardization of processes, systematic training and clearly defining the roles of management and employees. 3  His methods were widely adopted in the United States , Russia and parts of Europe and led to further developments such as time and motion study and visual task optimization techniques, such as Gantt charts . Peter Drucker  edit  In the latter part of the twentieth century, management guru Peter Drucker focused much of his work on simplification and decentralization of processes, which led to the concept of outsourcing . He also coined the concept of the  knowledge worker  as differentiated from manual workers  and how knowledge management would become part of an entitys processes. 9  10  Other definitions  edit  Davenport 1993 11  defines a business process as a structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market. It implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organization, in contrast to a product focuss emphasis on what. A process is thus a specific ordering of work activities across time and space, with a beginning and an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs a structure for action. ... Taking a process approach implies adopting the customers point of view. Processes are the structure by which an organization does what is necessary to produce value for its customers. This definition contains certain characteristics a process must possess. These characteristics are achieved by a focus on the business logic of the process how work is done, instead of taking a product perspective what is done. Following Davenports definition of a process we can conclude that a process must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output, that it consist s of smaller parts, activities, which are ordered in time and space, that there must be a receiver of the process outcome- a customer - and that the transformation taking place within the process must add customer value. Hammer  Champys 1993 12  definition can be considered as a subset of Davenports. They define a process as a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer. As we can note, Hammer  Champy have a more transformation oriented perception, and put less emphasis on the structural component  process boundaries and the order of activities in time and space. Rummler  Brache 1995 13  use a definition that clearly encompasses a focus on the organizations external customers, when stating that a business process is a series of steps designed to produce a product or service. Most processes ... are cross-functional, spanning the white space between the boxes on the organization chart. Some processes result in a product or service that is received by an organizations external customer. We call these primary processes. Other processes produce products that are invi sible to the external customer but essential to the effective management of the business. We call these support processes. The above definition distinguishes two types of processes, primary and support processes, depending on whether a process is directly involved in the creation of customer value, or concerned with the organizations internal activities. In this sense, Rummler and Braches definition follows Porters value chain model, which also builds on a division of primary and secondary activities. According to Rummler and Brache, a typical characteristic of a successful process-based organization is the absence of secondary activities in the primary value flow that is created in the customer oriented primary processes. The characteristic of processes as spanning the white space on the organizati on chart indicates that processes are embedded in some form of organizational structure. Also, a process can be cross-functional, i.e. it ranges over several business functions. Johansson et al. 1993. 14  define a process as a set of linked activities that take an input and transform it to create an output. Ideally, the transformation that occurs in the process should add value to the input and create an output that is more useful and effective to the recipient either upstream or downstream. This definition also emphasizes the constitution of links between activities and the transformation that takes place within the process. Johansson et al. also include the upstream part of the value chain as a possible recipient of the process output. Summarizing the four definitions above, we can compile the following list of characteristics for a business process Definability   It must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output. Order   It must consist of activities that are ordered according to their position in time and space a sequence. Customer   There must be a recipient of the process outcome, a customer. Value-adding   The transformation taking place within the process must add value to the recipient, either upstream or downstream. Embeddedness   A process cannot exist in itself, it must be embedded in an organizational structure. Cross-functionality   A process regularly can, but not necessarily must, span several functions. Frequently, identifying a process owner , i.e., the person responsible for the continuous improvement of the process is considered as a prerequisite. Sometimes the process owner is the same person who is performing the process. Related concepts  edit  Workflow  edit  Workflow is the procedural movement of information, material, and tasks from one participant to another. 15  Workflow includes the procedures, people and tools involved in each step of a business process. A single workflow may either be sequential, with each step contingent upon completion of the previous one, or parallel, with multiple steps occurring simultaneously. Multiple combinations of single workflows may be connected to achieve a resulting overall process. 15  Business process re-engineering  edit  Business process re-engineering BPR was originally conceptualized by Hammer and Davenport as a means to improve organizational effectiveness and productivity. It consisted of starting from a blank slate and completely recreating major business processes as well as the use of information technology for significant performance improvement. The term unfortunately became associated with corporate downsizing in the mid-1990s. 16  Business process management BPM  edit  Though the term has been used contextually to mixed effect,  business process management  BPM can generally be defined as a discipline involving a combination of a wide variety of business activity flows e.g., business process automation , modeling, and optimization that strives to support the goals of an enterprise within and beyond multiple boundaries, involving many people, from employees to customers and external partners. 17  A major part of BPMs enterprise support involves the continuous evaluation of existing processes and the identification of ways to improve upon it, resulting in a cycle of overall organizational improvement. Knowledge management  edit  Knowledge management is the definition of the knowledge that employees and systems use to perform their functions and maintaining it in a format that can be accessed by others. The Duhon and the Gartner Group have defined it as a discipline that promotes an integrated approach to identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of an enterprises information assets. These assets ma y include databases, documents, policies, procedures, and previously un-captured expertise and experience in individual workers. 18  Total quality management  edit  Total quality management TQM emerged in the early 1980s as organizations sought to improve the quality of their products and services. It was followed by the Six Sigma methodology in the mid-1980s, first introduced by Motorola. Six Sigma consists of statistical methods to improve business processes and thus reduce defects in outputs. The lean approach to quality management was introduced by the Toyota Motor Company in the 1990s and focused on customer needs and reduction of wastage. 19  20  21  Information technology as an enabler for business process management  edit  Advances in information technology over the years, have changed business processes within and between business enterprises. In the 1960s, operating systems had limited functionality, and any workflow management systems that were in use were tailor-made for the specific organization. The 1970s-1980s saw the development of data-driven approaches, as data storage and retrieval tec hnologies improved. Data modeling rather than process modeling was the starting point for building an information system. Business processes had to adapt to information technology because process modeling was neglected. The shift towards process-oriented management occurred in the 1990s. Enterprise resource planning software with workflow management components such as SAP, Baan , PeopleSoft , Oracle and JD Edwards emerged, as did business process management systems BPMS later. 22  The world of e-business created a need to automate business processes across organizations, which in turn raised the need for standardized protocols and web services composition languages that can be understood across the industry. The Business Process Modeling Notation BPMN and Business Motivation Model BMM are widely used standards for business modeling. 2  3  4  The Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task Force BMI DTF is a consortium of vendors and user companies that continues to work together to develop standards and specifications to promote collaboration and integration of people, systems, processes and information within and across enterprises. 23  The most recent trends in BPM are influenced by the emergence of cloud technology , the prevalence of social media , mobile technology, and the development of analytical techniques. Cloud-based technologies allow companies to purchase resources quickly and as required independent of their location. Social media, websites and smart phones are the newest channels through which organizations reach and support their customers. The abundance of customer data collected through these channels as w ell as through call center interactions, emails, voice calls, and customer surveys has led to a huge growth in data analytics which in turn is utilized for performance management and improving the ways in which the company services its customers. 24  Importance of the process chain  edit  Business processes comprise a set of sequential sub-processes or tasks with alternative paths, depending on certain conditions as applicable, performed to achieve a given objective or produce given outputs. Each process has one or more needed inputs. The inputs and outputs may be received from, or sent to other business processes, other organizational units , or internal or external stakeholders. 1  Business processes are designed to be operated by one or more business functional units, and emphasize the importance of the  process chain  rather than the individual units. In general, the various tasks of a business process can be performed in one of two ways 1  manually by means of business data processing systems such as ERP systems Typically, some process tasks will be manual, while some will be computer-based, and these tasks may be sequenced in many ways. In other words, the data and information that are being handled through the process may pass through manual or computer tasks in any given order. Policies, processes and procedures  edit  The above improvement areas are equally applicable to policies, processes, detailed procedures sub-processestasks and work instructions . There is a cascading effect of improvements made at a higher level on those made at a lower level. 25  For example, if a recommendation to replace a given policy with a better one is made with proper justification and accepted in principle by business process owners, then corresponding changes in the consequent processes and procedures will follow naturally in order to enable implementation of the policies. Reporting as an essential base for execution  edit  Business processes must include up-to-date and accurate reports to ensure effective action. 26  An example of this is the availability of purchase order status reports for supplier delivery follow-up as described in the section on effectiveness above. There are numerous examples of this in every possible business process. Another example from production is the process of analysis of line rejections occurring on the shop floor. This process should include systematic periodical analysis of rejections by reason, and present the results in a suitable information report that pinpoints the major reasons, and trends in these reasons, for management to take corrective actions to control rejections and keep them within acceptable limits. Such a process of analysis and summarisation of line rejection events is clearly superior to a process which merely inquires into each individual rejection as it occurs. Business process owners and operatives should realise that process improvement often occurs with introduction of appropriate transaction, operational, highlight, exception or M.I.S. reports, provided these are consciously used for day-to-day or periodical decision-making. With this understanding would hopefully come the willingness to invest time and other resources in business process improvement by introduction of useful and relevant reporting systems. Supporting theories and concepts  edit  Span of control  edit  The span of control is the number of subordinates a supervisor manages within a structural organization . Introducing a business process concept has a considerable impact on the structural elements of the organization and thus also on the span of control. 27  Large organizations that are not organized as markets need to be organized in smaller units  departments  which can be defined according to different principles. Information management concepts  edit  Information management , and the organization infrastructure strategies related to it, are a theoretical cornerstone of the business process concept, requiring a framework for measuring the level of IT support for business processes. 28  See also  edit  Business analysis Business method patent Business process automation Business Process Definition Metamodel Business process mapping Business process outsourcing References  edit   a b c d e Weske, M. 2012.

Thus, the name TQM now covers a very broad tent encompassing all sorts of management practices. In my management advisory activities I run into scores of these different programs all parading under the same name. Few are alike, and those varied programs have a wide variety of featuresa mixture of the old and the newwith, in more cases than not, very little of the new. ... However, I have forewarned you there are almost as many different TQM programs as there are companies that have started them because that creates confusion about what to do in your own case.
