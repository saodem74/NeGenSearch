Railway engineering From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Railway engineer redirects here. For the person who drives a train, see Railroad engineer . Railway engineering is a multi-faceted engineering discipline dealing with the design, construction and operation of all types of rail transport systems. It encompasses a wide range of engineering disciplines, including civil engineering , computer engineering , electrical engineering , mechanical engineering , industrial engineering and production engineering . A great many other engineering sub-disciplines are also called upon.

As the railways expanded and became a major economic force, a great many engineers became involved in the field, probably the most notable in Britain being Richard Trevithick , George Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel . Today, railway systems engineering continues to be a vibrant field of engineering.
