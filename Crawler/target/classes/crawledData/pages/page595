He was a professor of Information science at Syracuse University from 1970 to 1986. From then until his death he was Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University . He also held visiting positions at Aarhus University  Denmark , University of Edinburgh , Imperial College London , Microsoft Research  Cambridge  and Queen Mary, University of London  UK . Academic work  edit  Reynoldss main research interest was in the area of programming language design and associated specification languages , especially concerning formal semantics . He invented the polymorphic lambda calculus System F and formulated the property of semantic parametricity  the same calculus was independently discovered by Jean-Yves Girard . He wrote a seminal paper on definitional interpreters , which clarified early work on continuations and introduced the technique of defunctionalization . He applied category theory to programming language semantics . He defined the programming languages Gedanken and Forsythe , known for its use of intersection types . He worked on a separation logic to describe and reason about shared mutable data structures . He had been an editor of journals such as the Communications of the ACM and the Journal of the ACM . In 2001, he was appointed a Fellow of the ACM . He won the ACM SIGPLAN Programming Language Achievement Award in 2003, and the Lovelace Medal from the British Computer Society in 2010.
