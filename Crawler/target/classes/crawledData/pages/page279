An internal mirror allows the user to see the bubble in the level while sighting a distant target. It can be used as a hand-held instrument or mounted on a Jacobs staff for more precise measurement. 1  2  Abrams law  also called Abrams water-cement ratio law  3  is a concept in civil engineering . The law states the strength of a concrete mix is inversely related to the mass ratio of water to cement . 4  5  6  7  As the water content increases, the strength of concrete decreases. Abrasion  is the process of scuffing, scratching, wearing down, marring, or rubbing away. It can be intentionally imposed in a controlled process using an abrasive. Abrasion can be an undesirable effect of exposure to normal use or exposure to the elements. Abrasion resistance  Absolute electrode potential  in electrochemistry , according to an IUPAC definition, 8  is the electrode potential of a metal measured with respect to a universal reference system without any additional metalsolution interface. Absolute pressure  is zero-referenced against a perfect vacuum, using an absolute scale , so it is equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure. Absolute zero  is the lower limit of the thermodynamic temperature scale, a state at which the enthalpy and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reach their minimum value, taken as 0. Absolute zero is the point at which the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy -induced particle motion. The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law  by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as 273.15 on the Celsius scale  International System of Units , 9  10  which equals 459.67 on the Fahrenheit scale  United States customary units or Imperial units . 11  The corresponding Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition. Absorbance  In chemistry , absorbance or decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted radiant power through a material, and spectral absorbance or spectral decadic absorbance is the common logarithm of the ratio of incident to transmitted spectral radiant power through a material. 12  Absorbance is dimensionless , and in particular is not a length, though it is a monotonically increasing function of path length, and approaches zero as the path length approaches zero. Abutment  refers to the substructure at the ends of a bridge span or dam whereon the structures superstructure rests or contacts. 13  AC power  Power in an electric circuit is the rate of flow of energy past a given point of the circuit. In alternating current circuits, energy storage elements such as inductors and capacitors may result in periodic reversals of the direction of energy flow. Acceleration  In physics , acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time. An objects acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object, as described by Newtons Second Law . 14  The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared m s 2 . Accelerations are vector quantities they have magnitude and direction  and add according to the parallelogram law . 15  16  As a vector , the calculated net force is equal to the product of the objects mass a scalar quantity and its acceleration. Acid  is a molecule or ion capable of donating a hydron proton or hydrogen ion H  , or, alternatively, capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair a Lewis acid. 17  Acid-base reaction  is a chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base , which can be used to determine pH . Several theoretical frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems these are called the acidbase theories, for example, BrnstedLowry acidbase theory . Acid strength  refers to the tendency of an acid , symbolised by the chemical formula HA, to dissociate into a proton , H  , and an anion , A  . Acoustic board  is a special kind of board made of sound absorbing materials. Its job is to provide sound insulation. 18  19  Between two outer walls sound absorbing material is inserted and the wall is porous . Thus, when sound passes through an acoustic board, the intensity of sound is decreased. The loss of sound energy is balanced by producing heat energy. Acoustics  is the branch of physics that deals with the study of all mechanical waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration , sound , ultrasound and infrasound . Activated sludge  The activated sludge process is a type of wastewater treatment process for treating sewage or industrial wastewaters using aeration and a biological floc composed of bacteria and protozoa . Activated sludge model is a generic name for a group of mathematical methods to model activated sludge systems. The research in this area is coordinated by a task group of the International Water Association IWA. Activated sludge models are used in scientific research to study biological processes in hypothetical systems. They can also be applied on full scale wastewater treatment plants for optimisation, when carefully calibrated with reference data for sludge production and nutrients in the effluent. Active transport  In cellular biology, active transport is the movement of molecules across a membrane from a region of their lower concentration to a region of their higher concentrationagainst the concentration gradient. Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport primary active transport that uses ATP , and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient. Actuator  is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple a fixed mechanical or electronic system, software-based e.g. a printer driver, robot control system, a human, or any other input. 20  Acute angle  an angle that is smaller than a right angle less than 90. Adenosine triphosphate   ATP  is a complex organic chemical that provides energy to drive many processes in living cells , e.g. muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, chemical synthesis. Found in all forms of life, ATP is often referred to as the molecular unit of currency  of intracellular energy transfer . 21  When consumed in metabolic processes, it converts either to adenosine diphosphate ADP or to adenosine monophosphate AMP. Other processes regenerate ATP so that the human body recycles its own body weight equivalent in ATP each day. 22  It is also a precursor to DNA and RNA, and is used as a coenzyme . Adhesion  is the tendency of dissimilar particles or surfaces to cling to one another  cohesion refers to the tendency of similar or identical particlessurfaces to cling to one another. The forces that cause adhesion and cohesion can be divided into several types. The intermolecular forces responsible for the function of various kinds of stickers and sticky tape fall into the categories of chemical adhesion, dispersive adhesion, and diffusive adhesion. In addition to t he cumulative magnitudes of these intermolecular forces, there are also certain emergent mechanical effects. Adiabatic process  In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process is one that occurs without transfer of heat or mass of substances between a thermodynamic system and its surroundings. In an adiabatic process, energy is transferred to the surroundings only as work . 23  24  The adiabatic process provides a rigorous conceptual basis for the theory used to expound the first law of thermodynamics , and as such it is a key concept in thermodynamics . Aerobic digestion  is a process in sewage treatment designed to reduce the volume of sewage sludge and make it suitable 25  for subsequent use. 26  More recently, technology has been developed that allows the treatment and reduction of other 27  organic waste, such as food, cardboard and horticultural waste. Aerodynamics  is the study of the motion of air , particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. It is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics , and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. Afocal system  In optics an afocal system a system without focus is an optical system that produces no net convergence or divergence of the beam, i.e. has an infinite effective focal length . 28  Agricultural engineering  is the engineering discipline that studies agricultural production and processing. Agricultural engineering combines the disciplines of mechanical , civil , electrical and chemical engineering principles with a knowledge of agricultural principles according to technological principles. A key goal of this discipline is to improve the efficacy and sustainability of agricultural practices. 6  Albedo  is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body e.g. a planet like Earth . It is dimensionless and measured on a scale from 0 corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation to 1 corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation. Algae  Algebra  is one of the broad parts of mathematics , together with number theory , geometry and analysis . In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols 29  it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. 30  It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups , rings , and fields . The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra  the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics.

Amphoterism  In chemistry, an amphoteric compound is a molecule or ion that can react both as an acid and as a base . 43  Many metals such as copper , zinc , tin , lead , aluminium , and beryllium  form amphoteric oxides or hydroxides. Amphoterism depends on the oxidation states of the oxide. Al 2 O 3 is an example of an amphoteric oxide. Amplifier  An amplifier, electronic amplifier or informally amp is an electronic device that can increase the power of a signal a time-varying voltage or current . It is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output. The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain  the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. An amplifier is a circuit that has a power gain greater than one. 44  45  46  Amplitude  Anaerobic digestion  Angular acceleration  is the rate of change of angular velocity .

Its mode of deflection is primarily by bending . The loads applied to the beam result in reaction forces at the beams support points. The total effect of all the forces acting on the beam is to produce shear forces and bending moments within the beam, that in turn induce internal stresses, strains and deflections of the beam. Beams are characterized by their manner of support, profile shape of cross-section, length, and material.
