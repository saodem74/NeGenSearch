Kent Beck From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Kent Beck Born 1961 age  57 58 Citizenship United States Alma  mater University of Oregon Known  for Extreme programming , Software design patterns , JUnit Scientific career Fields Software engineering Institutions Gusto Beck speaking in 2001 Kent Beck born 1961 is an American software engineer and the creator of extreme programming , 1  a software development methodology that eschews rigid formal specification for a collaborative and iterative design process. Beck was one of the 17 original signatories of the Agile Manifesto , 1  the founding document for agile software development . Extreme and Agile methods are closely associated with Test-Driven Development TDD, of which Beck is perhaps the leading proponent. Beck pioneered software design patterns , as well as the commercial application of Smalltalk . He wrote the SUnit unit testing framework for Smalltalk, which spawned the xUnit series of frameworks, notably JUnit for Java, which Beck wrote with Erich Gamma . Beck popularized CRC cards with Ward Cunningham , the inventor of the wiki. He lives in San Francisco, California and worked at social media company Facebook . 2  Contents 1 History 2 Publications 2.1 Books 2.2 Selected papers 3 References 4 External links History  edit  Beck attended the University of Oregon between 1979 and 1987, receiving B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer and information science . 3  In 1996 Beck was hired to work on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System . Beck in turn brought in Ron Jeffries . In March 1996 the development team estimated the system would be ready to go into production around one year later. In 1997 the development team adopted a way of working which is now formalized as extreme programming . 1 The one-year delivery target was nearly achieved, with actual delivery being only a couple of months late.

ISBN   978-0321146533  Becks concept of test-driven development centers on two basic rules Never write a single line of code unless you have a failing automated test. Eliminate duplication. The book illustrates the use of unit testing as part of the methodology, including examples in Java and Python. One section includes using test-driven development to develop a unit testing framework. 2003. Contributing to Eclipse Principles, Patterns, and Plugins . With Erich Gamma . Addison-Wesley.
