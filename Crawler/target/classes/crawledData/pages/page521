Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or of volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources , such as financial , natural , technological , and human resources . The term management may also refer to those people who manage an organization. Social scientists study management as an academic discipline , investigating areas such as social organization and organizational leadership . 1  Some people study management at colleges or universities major degrees in management include the Bachelor of Commerce B.Com. Bachelor of Business Administration BBA. Master of Business Administration MBA. Master in Management MScM or MIM and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration MPA degree. Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management DM, the Doctor of Business Administration DBA, or the PhD in Business Administration or Management. There has recently been a movement for evidence-based management . Larger organizations generally have three levels of managers, which are typically organized  by whom  in a hierarchical , pyramid structure Senior managers , such as members of a Board of Directors and a Chief Executive Officer CEO or a President of an organization. They set the strategic goals of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate. Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals, and provide direction to middle management who directly or indirectly report to them. Middle managers , examples of these would include branch managers, regional managers, department managers and section managers, who provide direction to front-line managers. Middle managers communicate the strategic goals of senior management to the front-line managers. Lower managers , such as supervisors and front-line team leaders , oversee the work of regular employees or volunteers, in some voluntary organizations and provide direction on their work. In smaller organizations, an individual manager may have a much wider scope. A single manager may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization.

Management included as one of the factors of production  along with machines, materials and money. Ghislain Deslandes defines it as a vulnerable force, under pressure to achieve results and endowed with the triple power of constraint, imitation and imagination, operating on subjective, interpersonal, institutional and environmental levels. 3  Peter Drucker 19092005 saw the basic task of management as twofold marketing and innovation . Nevertheless, innovation is also linked to marketing product innovation is a central strategic marketing issue. Peter Drucker identifies marketing as a key essence for business success, but management and marketing are generally understood  by whom  as two different branches of business administration knowledge. Theoretical scope  edit  Management involves identifying the mission , objective, procedures, rules and manipulation 4  of the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise.  citation needed  This implies effective communication an enterprise environment as opposed to a physical or mechanical mechanism implies human motivation and implies some sort of successful progress or system outcome.  citation needed  As such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism machine or automated program, not the herding of animals, and can occur either in a legal or in an illegal enterprise or environment. From an individuals perspective, management does not need to be seen solely from an enterprise point of view, because management is an essential function to improve ones life and relationships .  citation needed  Management is therefore everywhere  citation needed  and it has a wider range of application.  clarification needed  Based on this, management must have humans. Communication and a positive endeavor are two main aspects of it either through enterprise or independent pursuit.  citation needed  Plans, measurements, motivational psychological tools, goals, and economic measures profit, etc. may or may not be necessary components for there to be management. At first, one views management functionally, such as measuring quantity, adjusting plans , meeting goals .  citation needed  This applies even in situations where planning does not take place. From this perspective, Henri Fayol 18411925 5   page  needed  considers management to consist of five functions  planning forecasting organizing commanding coordinating controlling In another way of thinking, Mary Parker Follett 18681933, allegedly defined management as the art of getting things done through people. 6  She described management as philosophy. 7   need quotation to verify  Critics  which  , however, find this definition useful but far too narrow. The phrase management is what managers do occurs widely, 8  suggesting the difficulty of defining management without circularity , the shifting nature of definitions  citation needed  and the connection of managerial practices with the existence of a managerial cadre or of a class . One habit of thought regards management as equivalent to  business administration  and thus excludes management in places outside commerce , as for example in charities and in the public sector . More broadly, every organization must manage its work, people, processes, technology, etc. to maximize effectiveness.  citation needed  Nonetheless, many people refer to university departments that teach management as  business schools . Some such institutions such as the Harvard Business School  use that name, while others such as the Yale School of Management  employ the broader term management. English-speakers may also use the term management or the management as a collective word describing the managers of an organization, for example of a corporation . 9  Historically this use of the term often contrasted with the term labor  referring to those being managed. 10  But in the present era  when  the concept of management is identified  by whom  in the wide areas  which  and its frontiers have been pushed to a broader range.  citation needed  Apart from profitable organizations even non-profitable organizations  NGOs  apply management concepts. The concept and its uses are not constrained  by whom  . Management on the whole is the process of planning, organizing, coordinating, leading and controlling. Nature of work  edit  In profitable organizations, managements primary function is the satisfaction of a range of stakeholders . This typically involves making a profit for the shareholders, creating valued products at a reasonable cost for customers, and providing great employment opportunities for employees. In nonprofit management, add the importance of keeping the faith of donors. In most models of management and governance , shareholders vote for the board of directors , and the board then hires senior management. Some organizations have experimented with other methods such as employee-voting models of selecting or reviewing managers, but this is rare. History  edit  Some see management as a late-modern in the sense of late modernity  conceptualization. 11  On those terms it cannot have a pre-modern history  only harbingers such as stewards . Others, however, detect management-like thought among ancient Sumerian traders and the builders of the pyramids of ancient Egypt . Slave-owners through the centuries faced the problems of exploitingmotivating a dependent but sometimes unenthusiastic or recalcitrant workforce, but many pre-industrial enterprises , given their small scale, did not feel compelled to face the issues of management systematically. However, innovations such as the spread of Hindu numerals 5th to 15th centuries and the codification of double-entry book-keeping 1494 provided tools for management assessment, planning and control. An organisation is more stable if members have the right to express their differences and solve their conflicts within it. While one person can begin an organisation, it is lasting when it is left in the care of many and when many desire to maintain it. A weak manager can follow a strong one, but not another weak one, and maintain authority. A manager seeking to change an established organization should retain at least a shadow of the ancient customs. With the changing workplaces of industrial revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries, military theory and practice contributed approaches to managing the newly-popular factories . 12  Given the scale of most commercial operations and the lack of mechanized record-keeping and recording before the industrial revolution, it made sense for most owners of enterprises in those times to carry out management functions by and for themselves. But with growing size and complexity of organizations, a distinction between owners individuals, industrial dynasties or groups of shareholders  and day-to-day managers independent specialists in planning and control gradually became more common. Etymology  edit  The English verb manage comes from the Italian maneggiare to handle, especially tools or a horse, which derives from the two Latin words manus hand and agere to act. The French word for housekeeping, mnagerie , derived from mnager to keep house compare mnage for household, also encompasses taking care of domestic animals. Mnagerie is the French translation of Xenophon s famous book Oeconomicus 13   Greek    on household matters and husbandry . The French word mesnagement or mnagement  influenced the semantic development of the English word management in the 17th and 18th centuries. 14  Early writing  edit  Management according to some definitions has existed for millennia, and several writers have produced background works that have contributed to modern management theories. 15   need quotation to verify  Some theorists have cited ancient military texts as providing lessons for civilian managers. For example, Chinese general Sun Tzu in his 6th-century BC work The Art of War recommends  citation needed  when re-phrased in modern terminology being aware of and acting on strengths and weaknesses of both a managers organization and a foes. 15   need quotation to verify  The writings of influential Chinese Legalist philosopher Shen Buhai may be considered  by whom  to embody a rare premodern example of abstract theory of administration. 16  Various ancient and medieval civilizations produced  mirrors for princes  books, which aimed to advise new monarchs on how to govern. Plato described job specialization in 350 BC, and Alfarabi listed several leadership traits in AD 900. 17  Other examples include the Indian Arthashastra by Chanakya written around 300 BC, and The Prince by Italian author Niccol Machiavelli c. 1515. 18  Further information Mirrors for princes Written in 1776 by Adam Smith , a Scottish moral philosopher , The Wealth of Nations discussed efficient organization of work through division of labour . 18  Smith described how changes in processes could boost productivity in the manufacture of pins . While individuals could produce 200 pins per day, Smith analyzed the steps involved in manufacture and, with 10 specialists, enabled production of 48,000 pins per day. 18   need quotation to verify  19th century  edit  Classical economists such as Adam Smith 17231790 and John Stuart Mill 18061873 provided a theoretical background to resource allocation , production , and pricing issues. About the same time, innovators like Eli Whitney 17651825, James Watt 17361819, and Matthew Boulton 17281809 developed elements of technical production such as standardization , quality-control procedures, cost-accounting , interchangeability of parts, and work-planning . Many of these aspects of management existed in the pre-1861 slave-based sector of the US economy. That environment saw 4 million people, as the contemporary usages had it, managed in profitable quasi- mass production . Salaried managers as an identifiable group first became prominent in the late 19th century. 19  20th century  edit  By about 1900 one finds managers trying to place their theories on what they regarded as a thoroughly scientific basis see scientism for perceived limitations of this belief. Examples include Henry R. Towne s Science of management in the 1890s, Frederick Winslow Taylor s The Principles of Scientific Management 1911, Lillian Gilbreth s Psychology of Management 1914, 20  Frank and Lillian Gilbreth s Applied motion study 1917, and Henry L. Gantt s charts 1910s. J. Duncan wrote the first college management- textbook in 1911. In 1912 Yoichi Ueno introduced Taylorism to Japan and became the first management consultant of the Japanese-management style. His son Ichiro Ueno pioneered Japanese quality assurance . The first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920.  citation needed  The Harvard Business School offered the first Master of Business Administration degree MBA in 1921. People like Henri Fayol 18411925 and Alexander Church 1866-1936 described the various branches of management and their inter-relationships. In the early-20th century, people like Ordway Tead 18911973, Walter Scott 1869-1955 and J. Mooney applied the principles of psychology to management. Other writers, such as Elton Mayo 18801949, Mary Parker Follett 18681933, Chester Barnard 18861961, Max Weber 18641920, who saw what he called the administrator as bureaucrat , 21  Rensis Likert 19031981, and Chris Argyris born 1923 approached the phenomenon of management from a sociological perspective. Peter Drucker 19092005 wrote one of the earliest books on applied management Concept of the Corporation published in 1946. It resulted from Alfred Sloan chairman of General Motors until 1956 commissioning a study of the organisation . Drucker went on to write 39 books, many in the same vein. H. Dodge, Ronald Fisher 18901962, and Thornton C. Fry introduced statistical techniques into management-studies. In the 1940s, Patrick Blackett worked in the development of the applied-mathematics science of operations research , initially for military operations. Operations research, sometimes known as  management science  but distinct from Taylors scientific management , attempts to take a scientific approach to solving decision-problems, and can apply directly to multiple management problems, particularly in the areas of logistics and operations. Some of the more recent update  developments include the Theory of Constraints , management by objectives , reengineering , Six Sigma , the Viable system model , and various information-technology -driven theories such as agile software development , as well as group-management theories such as Cogs Ladder . As the general recognition of managers as a class solidified during the 20th century and gave perceived practitioners of the artscience of management a certain amount of prestige, so the way opened for popularised systems of management ideas to peddle their wares. In this context many management fads may have had more to do with pop psychology than with scientific theories of management. Business management includes the following branches financial management human resource management information technology management responsible for management information systems  marketing management operations management and production management strategic management 21st century  edit  In the 21st century observers find it increasingly difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way. More and more processes simultaneously involve several categories. Instead, one tends to think in terms of the various processes, tasks, and objects subject to management.  citation needed  Branches of management theory also exist relating to nonprofits and to government such as public administration , public management , and educational management. Further, management programs related to civil-society organizations have also spawned programs in nonprofit management and social entrepreneurship . Note that many of the assumptions made by management have come under attack from business-ethics viewpoints, critical management studies , and anti-corporate activism . As one consequence, workplace democracy sometimes referred to as Workers self-management  has become both more common and more advocated, in some places distributing all management functions among workers, each of whom takes on a portion of the work. However, these models predate any current political issue, and may occur more naturally than does a command hierarchy . All management embraces to some degree a democratic principlein that in the long term, the majority of workers must support management. Otherwise, they leave to find other work or go on strike. Despite the move toward workplace democracy, command-and-control organization structures remain commonplace as de facto organization structures. Indeed, the entrenched nature of command-and-control is evident in the way that recent  when  layoffs have been conducted with management ranks affected far less than employees at the lower levels.  citation needed  In some cases, management has even rewarded itself with bonuses after laying off lower-level workers. 22  According to leadership-academic Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries , a contemporary senior-management team will almost inevitably have some personality disorders . 23  Topics  edit  Basics  edit  According to Fayol , management operates through five basic functions planning, organizing, coordinating, commanding, and controlling. Planning  Deciding what needs to happen in the future and generating plans for action deciding in advance. Organizing or staffing Making sure the human and nonhuman resources are put into place. 24  Coordinating  Creating a structure through which an organizations goals can be accomplished. Commanding or leading Determining what must be done in a situation and getting people to do it. Controlling  Checking progress against plans. Basic roles  edit  Interpersonal  roles that involve coordination and interaction with employees Figurehead, leader Informational  roles that involve handling, sharing, and analyzing information Nerve centre, disseminator Decision  roles that require decision-making Entrepreneur, negotiator, allocator Skills  edit  Management skills include political used to build a power base and to establish connections conceptual used to analyze complex situations interpersonal  used to communicate, motivate , mentor and delegate diagnostic ability to visualize appropriate responses to a situation leadership  ability to lead and to provide guidance to a specific group technical expertise in ones particular functional area. behavioral perception towards others. Implementation of policies and strategies  edit  All policies and strategies must be discussed with all managerial personnel and staff. Managers must understand where and how they can implement their policies and strategies. A plan of action must be devised for each department. Policies and strategies must be reviewed regularly. Contingency plans must be devised in case the environment changes. Top-level managers should carry out regular progress assessments. The business requires team spirit and a good environment. The missions, objectives, strengths and weaknesses of each department must be analyzed to determine their roles in achieving the businesss mission. The forecasting method develops a reliable picture of the business future environment. A planning unit must be created to ensure that all plans are consistent and that policies and strategies are aimed at achieving the same mission and objectives. Policies and strategies in the planning process  edit  They give mid and lower-level managers a good idea of the future plans for each department in an organization. A framework is created whereby plans and decisions are made. Mid and lower-level management may add their own plans to the businesss strategies. Levels  edit  Most organizations have three management levels first-level, middle-level, and top-level managers. First-line managers are the lowest level of management and manage the work of nonmanagerial individuals who are directly involved with the production or creation of the organizations products. First-line managers are often called supervisors, but may also be called line managers , office managers, or even foremen. Middle managers include all levels of management between the first-line level and the top level of the organization. These managers manage the work of first-line managers and may have titles such as department head, project leader, plant manager, or division manager. Top managers are responsible for making organization-wide decisions and esta blishing the plans and goals that affect the entire organization. These individuals typically have titles such as executive vice president, president, managing director, chief operating officer, chief executive officer, or chairman of the board. These managers are classified in a hierarchy of authority, and perform different tasks. In many organizations, the number of managers in every level resembles a pyramid. Each level is explained below in specifications of their different responsibilities and likely job titles.  citation needed  Top  edit  The top or senior layer of management consists of the board of directors including non-executive directors and executive directors , president, vice-president, CEOs and other members of the C-level executives. Different organizations have various members in their C-suite, which may include a Chief Financial Officer , Chief Technology Officer , and so on. They are responsible for controlling and overseeing the operations of the entire organization. They set a  tone at the top  and develop strategic plans , company policies, and make decisions on the overall direction of the organization. In addition, top-level managers play a significant role in the mobilization of outside resources. Senior managers are accountable to the shareholders, the general public and to public bodies that oversee corporations and similar organizations. Some members of the senior management may serve as the public face of the organization, and they may make speeches to introduce new strategies or appear in marketing. The board of directors is typically primarily composed of non-executives who owe a fiduciary duty to shareholders and are not closely involved in the day-to-day activities of the organization, although this varies depending on the type e.g., public versus private, size and culture of the organization. These directors are theoretically liable for breaches of that duty and typically insured under directors and officers liability insurance . Fortune 500 directors are estimated to spend 4.4 hours per week on board duties, and median compensation was 212,512 in 2010. The board sets corporate strategy, makes major decisions such as major acquisitions, 25  and hires, evaluates, and fires the top-level manager  Chief Executive Officer or CEO. The CEO typically hires other positions. However, board involvement in the hiring of other positions such as the Chief Financial Officer CFO has increased. 26  In 2013, a survey of over 160 CEOs and directors of public and private companies found that the top weaknesses of CEOs were  mentoring skills and board engagement, and 10 of companies never evaluated the CEO. 27  The board may also have certain employees e.g., internal auditors  report to them or directly hire independent contractors for example, the board through the audit committee  typically selects the auditor . Helpful skills of top management vary by the type of organization but typically include 28  a broad understanding of competition, world economies, and politics. In addition, the CEO is responsible for implementing and determining within the boards framework the broad policies of the organization. Executive management accomplishes the day-to-day details, including instructions for preparation of department budgets, procedures, schedules appointment of middle leve l executives such as department managers coordination of departments media and governmental relations and shareholder communication. Middle  edit  Consist of general managers , branch managers and department managers. They are accountable to the top management for their departments function. They devote more time to organizational and directional functions. Their roles can be emphasized as executing organizational plans in conformance with the companys policies and the objectives of the top management, they define and discuss information and poli cies from top management to lower management, and most importantly they inspire and provide guidance to lower level managers towards better performance. Middle management is the midway management of a categorized organization, being secondary to the senior management but above the deepest levels of operational members. An operational manager may be well-thought-out by middle management, or may be categorized as non-management operate, liable to the policy of the specific organization. Efficiency of the middle level is vital in any organization, since they bridge the gap between top level and bottom level staffs. Their functions include Design and implement effective group and inter-group work and information systems. Define and monitor group-level performance indicators. Diagnose and resolve problems within and among work groups. Design and implement reward systems that support cooperative behavior. They also make decision and share ideas with top managers. Lower  edit  Lower managers include supervisors , section leaders, forepersons and team leaders. They focus on controlling and directing regular employees. They are usually responsible for assigning employees tasks, guiding and supervising employees on day-to-day activities, ensuring the quality and quantity of production andor service, making recommendations and suggestions to employees on their work, and channeling emplo yee concerns that they cannot resolve to mid-level managers or other administrators. First-level or front line managers also act as role models for their employees. In some types of work, front line managers may also do some of the same tasks that employees do, at least some of the time. For example, in some restaurants, the front line managers will also serve customers durin g a very busy period of the day. Front-line managers typically provide Training for new employees Basic supervision Motivation Performance feedback and guidance Some front-line managers may also provide career planning for employees who aim to rise within the organization. Training  edit  Colleges and universities around the world offer bachelors degrees, graduate degrees, diplomas and certificates in management, generally within their colleges of business, business schools or faculty of management but also in other related departments. In the 2010s, there has been an increase in online management education and training in the form of electronic educational technology  also called e-learning. Online education has increased the accessibility of management training to people who do not live near a college or university, or who cannot afford to travel to a city where such training is available. While some professions require academic credentials in order to work in the profession e.g., law, medicine, engineering, which require, respectively the Bachelor of Law , Doctor of Medicine and Bachelor of Engineering degrees, management and administration positions do not necessarily require the completion of academic degrees. Some well-known senior executives in the US who did not complete a degree include Steve Jobs , Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg . However, many managers and executives have completed some type of business or management training, such as a Bachelor of Commerce or a Master of Business Administration degree. Some major organizations, including companies, not-for-profit organizations and governments, require applicants to managerial or executive positions to hold at minimum Bachelors degree in a field related to administration or management, or in the case of business jobs, a Bachelor of Commerce or a similar degree. United States of America  edit  Undergraduate  edit  At the undergraduate level, the most common business program is the Bachelor of Commerce B.Com.. However to manage technological areas, you need an undergraduate degree in a STEM area as preferred to Defense Acquisition University guidelines. This is typically a four-year program that includes courses that give students an overview of the role of managers in planning and directing within an organization. Course topics include accounting, financial management, statistics, marketing, strategy, and other related areas. There are many other undergraduate degrees that include the study of management, such as Bachelor of Arts degrees with a major in business administration or management and Bachelor of Public Administration B.P.A, a degree designed for individuals aiming to work as bureaucrats in the government jobs . Many colleges and universities also offer certificates and diplomas in business administration or management, which typically require one to two years of full-time study. Graduate  edit  At the graduate level students aiming at careers as managers or executives may choose to specialize in major subareas of management or business administration such as entrepreneurship , human resources , international business , organizational behavior , organizational theory , strategic management , 29  accounting , corporate finance , entertainment, global management, healthcare management , investment management , sustainability and real estate . A Master of Business Administration MBA is the most popular professional degree at the masters level and can be obtained from many universities in the United States. MBA programs provide further education in management and leadership for graduate students. Other masters degrees in business and management include Master of Management MM and the Master of Science M.Sc. in business administration or management, which is typically taken by students aiming to become researchers or professors. There are also specialized masters degrees in administration for individuals aiming at careers outside of business, such as the Master of Public Administration MPA degree also offered as a Master of Arts in Public Administration in some universities, for students aiming to become managers or executives in the public service and the Master of Health Administration , for students aiming to become managers or executives in the health care and hospital sector. Management doctorates are the most advanced terminal degrees in the field of business and management. Most individuals obtaining management doctorates take the programs to obtain the training in research methods, statistical analysis and writing academic papers that they will need to seek careers as researchers, senior consultants andor professors in business administration or management. There are three main types of management doctor ates the Doctor of Management D.M., the Doctor of Business Administration D.B.A., and the Ph.D. in Business Administration or Management. In the 2010s, doctorates in business administration and management are available with many specializations. Good practices  edit  While management trends can change so fast, the long term trend in management has been defined by a market embracing diversity and a rising service industry. Managers are currently being trained to encourage greater equality for minorities and women in the workplace, by offering increased flexibility in working hours, better retraining, and innovative and usually industry-spec ific performance markers. Managers destined for the service sector are being trained to use unique measurement techniques, better worker support and more charismatic leadership styles. 30  Human resources finds itself increasingly working with management in a training capacity to help collect management data on the success or failure of management actions with employees. 31  Evidence-based management  edit  Main article Evidence-based management Evidence-based management is an emerging movement to use the current, best evidence in management and decision-making . It is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices . Evidence-based management entails managerial decisions and organizational practices informed by the best available evidence. 32  As with other evidence-based practice, this is based on the three principles of 1 published peer-reviewed often in management or social science journals research evidence that bears on whether and why a particular management practice works 2 judgement and experience from contextual management practice, to understand the organization and interpersonal dynamics in a situat ion and determine the risks and benefits of available actions and 3 the preferences and values of those affected. 33  34  See also  edit  Educational management Outline of business management References  edit   Waring, S.P., 2016.
