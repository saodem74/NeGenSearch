An information technology system  IT system  is generally an information system , a communications system or, more specifically speaking, a computer system  including all hardware , software and peripheral equipment  operated by a limited group of users. Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000  BC, 3  but the term information technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review  authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that the new technology does not yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology IT. Their definition consists of three categories techniques for processing, the application of statistical and mathematical methods to decision-making , and the simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs. 4  The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services within an economy are associated with information technology, including computer hardware , software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom equipment , and e-commerce . 5  a  Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT development pre-mechanical 3000  BC   1450  AD, mechanical 14501840, electromechanical 18401940, and electronic 1940present. 3  This article focuses on the most recent period electronic.

The Zuse Z3 is the first programmable computer. Main article History of computing hardware Devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years, probably initially in the form of a tally stick . 7  The Antikythera mechanism , dating from about the beginning of the first century BC, is generally considered to be the earliest known mechanical analog computer , and the earliest known geared mechanism. 8  Comparable geared devices did not emerge in Europe until the 16th century, and it was not until 1645 that the first mechanical calculator capable of performing the four basic arithmetical operations was developed. 9  Electronic computers , using either relays or valves , began to appear in the early 1940s. The electromechanical Zuse Z3 , completed in 1941, was the worlds first programmable computer, and by modern standards one of the first machines that could be considered a complete computing machine. Colossus , developed during the Second World War to decrypt German messages, was the first electronic digital computer. Although it was programmable , it was not general-purpose, being designed to perform only a single task. It also lacked the ability to store its program in memory programming was carried out using plugs and switches to alter the internal wiring. 10  The first recognisably modern electronic digital stored-program computer was the Manchester Baby , which ran its first program on 21 June 1948. 11  The development of transistors in the late 1940s at Bell Laboratories allowed a new generation of computers to be designed with greatly reduced power consumption. The first commercially available stored-program computer, the Ferranti Mark I , contained 4050 valves and had a power consumption of 25 kilowatts. By comparison the first transistorised computer, developed at the University of Manchester and operational by November 1953, consumed only 150 watts in its final version. 12  Electronic data processing  edit  Main article Electronic data processing Data storage  edit  Punched tapes were used in early computers to represent data . Main article Data storage device Early electronic computers such as Colossus made use of punched tape , a long strip of paper on which data was represented by a series of holes, a technology now obsolete. 13  Electronic data storage, which is used in modern computers, dates from World War II, when a form of delay line memory was developed to remove the clutter from radar signals, the first practical application of which was the mercury delay line. 14  The first random-access digital storage device was the Williams tube , based on a standard cathode ray tube , 15  but the information stored in it and delay line memory was volatile in that it had to be continuously refreshed, and thus was lost once power was removed. The earliest form of non-volatile computer storage was the magnetic drum , invented in 1932 16  and used in the Ferranti Mark 1 , the worlds first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer. 17  IBM introduced the first hard disk drive in 1956, as a component of their 305 RAMAC computer system. 18   6 Most digital data today is still stored magnetically on hard disks, or optically on media such as CD-ROMs . 19   45 Until 2002 most information was stored on analog devices , but that year digital storage capacity exceeded analog for the first time. As of 2007 almost 94 of the data stored worldwide was held digitally 20  52 on hard disks, 28 on optical devices and 11 on digital magnetic tape. It has been estimated that the worldwide capacity to store information on electronic devices grew from less than 3 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007, 21  doubling roughly every 3 years. 22  Databases  edit  Main article Database Database Management Systems DMS emerged in the 1960s to address the problem of storing and retrieving large amounts of data accurately and quickly. An early such systems was IBM s Information Management System IMS, 23  which is still widely deployed more than 50 years later. 24  IMS stores data hierarchically , 23  but in the 1970s Ted Codd proposed an alternative relational storage model based on set theory and predicate logic and the familiar concepts of tables, rows and columns. In 1981, the first commercially available relational database management system RDBMS was released by Oracle . 25  All DMS consist of components, they allow the data they store to be accessed simultaneously by many users while maintaining its integrity. 26  All databases are common in one point that the structure of the data they contain is defined and stored separately from the data itself, in a database schema . 23  In recent years, the extensible markup language XML has become a popular format for data representation. Although XML data can be stored in normal file systems , it is commonly held in relational databases to take advantage of their robust implementation verified by years of both theoretical and practical effort. 27  As an evolution of the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML, XMLs text-based structure offers the advantage of being both machine and human-readable. 28  Data retrieval  edit  The relational database model introduced a programming-language independent Structured Query Language SQL, based on relational algebra . The terms data and information are not synonymous. Anything stored is data, but it only becomes information when it is organized and presented meaningfully. 29   19 Most of the worlds digital data is unstructured, and stored in a variety of different physical formats 30  b  even within a single organization. Data warehouses began to be developed in the 1980s to integrate these disparate stores. They typically contain data extracted from various sources, including external sources such as the Internet, organized in such a way as to facilitate decision support systems DSS. 31   46 Data transmission  edit  Data transmission has three aspects transmission, propagation, and reception. 32  It can be broadly categorized as broadcasting , in which information is transmitted unidirectionally downstream, or telecommunications , with bidirectional upstream and downstream channels. 21  XML has been increasingly employed as a means of data interchange since the early 2000s, 33  particularly for machine-oriented interactions such as those involved in web-oriented protocols such as SOAP , 28  describing data-in-transit rather than  ... data-at-rest. 33  Data manipulation  edit  Hilbert and Lopez identify the exponential pace of technological change a kind of Moores law  machines application-specific capacity to compute information per capita roughly doubled every 14 months between 1986 and 2007 the per capita capacity of the worlds general-purpose computers doubled every 18 months during the same two decades the global telecommunication capacity per capita doubled every 34 months the worlds storage capacity per capita required roughly 40 months to double every 3 years and per capita broadcast information has doubled every 12.3 years. 21  Massive amounts of data are stored worldwide every day, but unless it can be analysed and presented effectively it essentially resides in what have been called data tombs data archives that are seldom visited. 34  To address that issue, the field of data mining   the process of discovering interesting patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data 35    emerged in the late 1980s. 36  Perspectives  edit  Academic perspective  edit  In an academic context, the Association for Computing Machinery defines IT as undergraduate degree programs that prepare students to meet the computer technology needs of business, government, healthcare, schools, and other kinds of organizations  .... IT specialists assume responsibility for selecting hardware and software products appropriate for an organization, integrating those products with organizational needs and infrastructure, and installing, customizing, and maintaining those applications for the organizations computer users. 37  Commercial and employment perspective  edit  Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the tech sector or the tech industry. 38  39  40  41  Many companies now have IT departments for managing the computers, networks, and other technical areas of their businesses. In a business context, the Information Technology Association of America has defined information technology as the study, design, development, application, implementation, support or management of computer-based information systems. 42   page  needed  The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organizations technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded and replaced.

This useful conceptual term has since been converted to what purports to be concrete use, but without t he reinforcement of definition  ... the term IT lacks substance when applied to the name of any function, discipline, or position. 6   Format refers to the physical characteristics of the stored data such as its encoding scheme structure describes the organisation of that data.
