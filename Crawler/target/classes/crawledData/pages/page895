The field of polymer science includes researchers in multiple disciplines including chemistry , physics , and engineering . Contents 1 Subdisciplines 2 History of polymer science 3 Nobel prizes related to polymer science 4 References 5 External links Subdisciplines  edit  This science comprises three main sub-disciplines Polymer chemistry or macromolecular chemistry is concerned with the chemical synthesis and chemical properties of polymers. Polymer physics is concerned with the bulk properties of polymer materials and engineering applications. Polymer characterization is concerned with the analysis of chemical structure, morphology, and the determination of physical properties in relation to compositional and structural parameters. History of polymer science  edit  The first modern example of polymer science is Henri Braconnot s work in the 1830s. Henri, along with Christian Schnbein and others, developed derivatives of the natural polymer cellulose , producing new, semi-synthetic materials, such as celluloid and cellulose acetate . The term polymer was coined in 1833 by Jns Jakob Berzelius , though Berzelius did little that would be considered polymer science in the modern sense. In the 1840s, Friedrich Ludersdorf and Nathaniel Hayward independently discovered that adding sulfur to raw natural rubber  polyisoprene  helped prevent the material from becoming sticky. In 1844 Charles Goodyear received a U.S. patent for vulcanizing natural rubber with sulfur and heat. Thomas Hancock had received a patent for the same process in the UK the year before. This process strengthened natural rubber and prevented it from melting with heat without losing flexibility. This made practical products such as waterproofed articles possible. It also facilitated practical manufacture of such rubberized materials. Vulcanized rubber represents the first commercially succes sful product of polymer research. In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet started the first artificial fiber plant based on regenerated cellulose , or viscose rayon , as a substitute for silk , but it was very flammable. 1  In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic plastic, a thermosetting phenol  formaldehyde resin called Bakelite . 2  Despite significant advances in polymer synthesis, the molecular nature of polymers was not understood until the work of Hermann Staudinger in 1922. 3  Prior to Staudingers work, polymers were understood in terms of the association theory or aggregate theory, which originated with Thomas Graham in 1861. Graham proposed that cellulose and other polymers were colloids , aggregates of molecules having small molecular mass connected by an unknown intermolecular force. Hermann Staudinger was the first to propose that polymers consisted of long chains of atoms held together by covalent bonds . It took over a decade for Staudingers work to gain wide acceptance in the scientific community, work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953. The World War II era marked the emergence of a strong commercial polymer industry. The limited or restricted supply of natural materials such as silk and rubber necessitated the increased production of synthetic substitutes, such as nylon 4  and synthetic rubber . 5  In the intervening years, the development of advanced polymers such as Kevlar and Teflon have continued to fuel a strong and growing polymer industry. The growth in industrial applications was mirrored by the establishment of strong academic programs and research institute. In 1946, Herman Mark established the Polymer Research Institute at Brooklyn Polytechnic , the first research facility in the United States dedicated to polymer research. Mark is also recognized as a pioneer in establishing curriculum and pedagogy for the field of polymer science. 6  In 1950, the POLY division of the American Chemical Society was formed, and has since grown to the second-largest division in this association with nearly 8,000 members. Fred W. Billmeyer, Jr., a Professor of Analytical Chemistry had once said that although the scarcity of education in polymer science is slowly diminishing but it is still evident in many areas. What is most unfortunate is that it appears to exist, not because of a lac k of awareness but, rather, a lack of interest. 7  Nobel prizes related to polymer science  edit  2005 Chemistry Robert Grubbs , Richard Schrock , Yves Chauvin for olefin metathesis. 8  2002 Chemistry John Bennett Fenn , Koichi Tanaka , and Kurt Wthrich for the development of methods for identification and structure analyses of biological macromolecules . 9  2000 Chemistry Alan G.
