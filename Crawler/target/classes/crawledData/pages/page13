Moura President  CEO Revenue US413 million Website www .ieee .org The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  IEEE  is a professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering and associated disciplines with its corporate office in New York City 3  and its operations center in Piscataway, New Jersey . It was formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio Engineers . 4  Due to its expansion of scope into so many related fields, it is simply referred to by the letters I-E-E-E pronounced Eye-triple-E, except on legal business documents. As of 2018 update  , it is the worlds largest association of technical professionals 5  with more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries around the world. 6  Its objectives are the educational and technical advancement of electrical and electronic engineering , telecommunications , computer engineering and allied disciplines. 3  7  Contents 1 History 1.1 Origins 1.2 Growth 1.3 Controversies 1.3.1 Huawei Ban 2 Publications 3 Educational activities 4 Membership grades 5 Medals and awards 6 Technical societies under the IEEE 7 Technical councils 8 Technical committees 9 IEEE Foundation 10 Legal issues 11 See also 12 References History  edit  Origins  edit  See also American Institute of Electrical Engineers   History , and Institute of Radio Engineers   History The IEEE traces its founding to 1884 and the American Institute of Electrical Engineers . In 1912, the rival Institute of Radio Engineers was formed. Although the AIEE was initially larger, the IRE attracted more students and was larger by the mid 1950s. Growth  edit  The AIEE and the IRE merged to create the IEEE on 1 January 1963. At that time, the combined group had 150,000 members, 93 in the United States. By 1984 there were 250,000 members, 20 of whom were outside the U.S. Today, IEEE has over 420,000 members in 160 countries, with 44.5 percent outside of the U.S This international growth continues today. 8  The IEEE headquarters is in New York City at 3 Park Ave, but most business is done at the IEEE Operations Center 9  in Piscataway, NJ, first occupied in 1975. Controversies  edit  Huawei Ban  edit  In May 2019, IEEE banned Huawei employees from peer-reviewing papers or handling papers as editors. As members of its standard-setting body, Huawei employees can also continue to exercise their voting rights, attend standards development meetings, submit proposals and comment in public discussions on new standards. 10  11  12  The IEEE ban has sparked outrage among Chinese scientists on social media. Some professors in China decided to quit from IEEE. 13  14  On June 3, 2019, IEEE released a statement, in which it proactively lifted restrictions on Huaweis editorial and peer review activities. 15  16  17  Publications  edit  Main article List of IEEE publications IEEE produces over 30 of the worlds literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields, publishing well over 100 peer-reviewed journals 18  19  and magazines it also sponsors over 1800 conferences and events. The published content in these journals as well as the content from several hundred annual conferences sponsored by the IEEE are available in the IEEE online digital library and research database, IEEE Xplore 20  , for subscription-based access and individual publication purchases. 21  In addition to journals and conference proceedings, the IEEE also publishes tutorials and standards that are produced by its standardization committees. Organization also has its own IEEE format paper. In writing IEEE papers, it is not just a matter of mentioning the authors name or the page number or the date an article was published. The most important aspect is referring to the source by indicating its number in a square bracket and ensure it corresponds with the full citation as mentioned in the reference list. 22  Educational activities  edit  The IEEE provides learning opportunities within the engineering sciences, research, and technology. IEEE offers educational opportunities such as IEEE e Learning Library , 23  the Education Partners Program , 24  Standards in Education 25  and Continuing Education Units CEUs. 26  IEEE eLearning Library is a collection of online educational courses designed for self-paced learning. Education Partners, exclusive for IEEE members, offers on-line degree programs, certifications and courses at a 10 discount. The Standards in Education website explains what standards are and the importance of developing and using them. The site includes tutorial modules and case illustrations to introduce the history of standards, the basic terminology, their applications and impact on products, as well as news related to standards, book reviews and links to other sites that contain information on standards. Currently, twenty-nine states in the United States require Professional Development Hours PDH to maintain a Professional Engineering license , 27  28  encouraging engineers to seek Continuing Education Units CEUs for their participation in continuing education programs. CEUs readily translate into Professional Development Hours PDHs, with 1 CEU being equivalent to 10 PDHs. Countries outside the United States, such as South Africa, similarly require continuing professional development CPD credits, and it is anticipated that IEEE Expert Now courses will feature in the CPD listing for South Africa. IEEE also sponsors a website designed to help young people better understand engineering, and how an engineering career can be made part of their future. Students of age 818, parents, and teachers can explore the site to prepare for an engineering career, ask experts engineering-related questions, play interactive games, explore curriculum links, and review lesson plans. This website also allows students to search for accredited engineering degree programs in Canada and the United States visitors are able to search by stateprovinceterritory, country, degree field, tuition ranges, room and board ranges, size of student body, and location rural, suburban, or urban. Through the Student Activities Committee, IEEE facilitates partnership between student activities and all other IEEE entities. 29  Membership grades  edit  Most IEEE members are electrical and electronics engineers, but the organizations wide scope of interests has attracted people in other disciplines as well e.g., computer science , software engineering , mechanical engineering , civil engineering , biology , physics , and mathematics . An individual can join the IEEE as a student member, professional member, or associate member. In order to qualify for membership, the individual must fulfill certain academic or professional criteria and abide to the code of ethics and bylaws of the organization. There are several categories and levels of IEEE membership and affiliation Student Members  Student membership is available for a reduced fee to those who are enrolled in an accredited institution of higher education as undergraduate or graduate students in technology or engineering. Graduate Student Members  Graduate Student Membership is discounted but members at this level have greater privileges than do Student Members. Members  Ordinary or professional Membership requires that the individual have graduated from a technology or engineering program of an appropriately accredited institution of higher education or have demonstrated professional competence in technology or engineering through at least six years of professional work experience. An associate membership is available to an individual whose area of expertise falls outside the s cope of the IEEE or who does not, at the time of enrollment, meet all the requirements for full membership. Students and Associates have all the privileges of members, except the right to vote and hold certain offices. Society Affiliates  Some IEEE Societies also allow a person who is not an IEEE member to become a Society Affiliate of a particular Society within the IEEE, which allows a limited form of participation in the work of a particular IEEE Society. Senior Members  Upon meeting certain requirements, a professional member can apply for Senior Membership , which is the highest level of recognition that a professional member can directly apply for. Applicants for Senior Member must have at least three letters of recommendation from Senior, Fellow, or Honorary members and fulfill other rigorous requirements of education, achievement, remarkable contribution, and experience in the field. The Senior Members are a selected group, an d certain IEEE officer positions are available only to Senior and Fellow Members. Senior Membership is also one of the requirements for those who are nominated and elevated to the grade IEEE Fellow , a distinctive honor. Fellow Members  The Fellow grade is the highest level of membership, conferred by the IEEE Board of Directors upon persons with extraordinary records of accomplishments in any of the IEEE fields of interest. It cannot be applied for directly by the member the candidate must be nominated by others, and of the Institutes voting membership, no more than one in one thousand can be selected as Fellows in any given year. 30  Honorary Members  Individuals who are not IEEE members but have demonstrated exceptional contributions, such as being a recipient of an IEEE Medal of Honor , may receive Honorary Membership from the IEEE Board of Directors. 31  Life Members , Life Senior Members and Life Fellows  Members who have reached the age of 65 and whose number of years of membership plus their age in years adds up to at least 100 are recognized as Life Members , Life Senior Members or Life Fellows , as appropriate. Medals and awards  edit  Main article List of IEEE awards Technical societies under the IEEE  edit  Various technical areas are addressed by IEEEs 39 societies, each one focused on a certain knowledge area. They provide specialized publications, conferences, business networking and sometimes other services. 32  IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society IEEE Antennas  Propagation Society IEEE Broadcast Technology Society IEEE Circuits and Systems Society IEEE Communications Society IEEE Components, Packaging  Manufacturing Technology Society IEEE Computational Intelligence Society IEEE Computer Society IEEE Consumer Electronics Society IEEE Control Systems Society IEEE Dielectrics  Electrical Insulation Society IEEE Education Society IEEE Electromagnetic Compatibility Society IEEE Electron Devices Society IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society IEEE Industrial Electronics Society IEEE Industry Applications Society IEEE Information Theory Society IEEE Instrumentation  Measurement Society IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society IEEE Magnetics Society IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society IEEE Photonics Society IEEE Power Electronics Society IEEE Power  Energy Society IEEE Product Safety Engineering Society IEEE Professional Communication Society IEEE Reliability Society IEEE Robotics and Automation Society IEEE Signal Processing Society IEEE Society on Social Implications of Technology IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society IEEE Systems, Man  Cybernetics Society IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics  Frequency Control Society IEEE Technology and Engineering Management Society IEEE Vehicular Technology Society Technical councils  edit  IEEE technical councils are collaborations of several IEEE societies on a broader knowledge area. There are currently seven technical councils 33  IEEE Biometrics Council IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation IEEE Nanotechnology Council IEEE Sensors Council IEEE Council on Superconductivity IEEE Systems Council IEEE Council on RFID CRFID 34  Technical committees  edit  To allow a quick response to new innovations, IEEE can also organize technical committees on top of their technical societies and technical councils . There are currently over twenty such technical committees 35  . IEEE Foundation  edit  The IEEE Foundation 36  is a charitable foundation established in 1973 37  to support and promote technology education, innovation and excellence. 38  It is incorporated separately from the IEEE, although it has a close relationship to it. Members of the Board of Directors of the foundation are required to be active members of IEEE, and one third of them must be current or former members of the IEEE Board of Directors. Initially, the role of the IEEE Foundation was to accept and administer donations for the IEEE Awards program, but donations increased beyond what was necessary for this purpose, and the scope was broadened. In addition to soliciting and administering unrestricted funds, the foundation also administers donor-designated funds supporting particular educational, humanitarian, hist orical preservation, and peer recognition programs of the IEEE. 38  As of the end of 2014, the foundations total assets were nearly 45 million, split equally between unrestricted and donor-designated funds. 39  Legal issues  edit  In May 2018, Intellitech Corp., an EDA software company from Dover, New Hampshire , filed a suit against IEEE to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire , claiming that the IEEE had copied, used and modified technical documents which contained Intellitechs watermark, and moved for summary judgment , requesting to establish IEEEs liability for copyright infringement. The court denied Intellitechs request for summary judgment and concluded that the doctrine of implied license put forth by the IEEE is highly fact-specific, thus precluding summary judgment. 40  The court also denied the IEEEs motion for summary judgment, which sought to preclude Intellitech from recovering statutory damages , attorney fees , and injunction , based on Title 17 of the United States Code  4121. 40  See also  edit  Glossary of electrical and electronics engineering Engineering and Technology History Wiki IEEE Eta Kappa Nu Honor society IEEE History Center 41  Certified Software Development Professional CSDP Program of the IEEE Computer Society Institution of Engineering and Technology UK IEEE Cloud Computing IEEE conferences IEEE Standards Association IEEE Xplore , research database and online digital library archive GlobalSpec - acquired by IEEE in 2016, having partnered with them and using their search engine of engineering and industrial products. 42  List of IEEE Fellows References  edit    Form 990 Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax 2017 .
