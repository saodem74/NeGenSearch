It is the principal fact-finding agency for the U.S. government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics and serves as a principal agency of the U.S. Federal Statistical System . The BLS is a governmental statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress , other Federal agencies, State and local governments, business, and labor representatives. The BLS also serves as a statistical resource to the United States Department of Labor, and conducts research into how much families need to earn to be able to enjoy a decent standard of living. 4  The BLS data must satisfy a number of criteria, including relevance to current social and economic issues, timeliness in reflecting todays rapidly changing economic conditions, accuracy and consistently high statistical quality, impartiality in both subject matter and presentation, and accessibility to all. To avoid the appearance of partiality, the dates of major data releas es are scheduled more than a year in advance, in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget . 5  Contents 1 History 2 Statistical reporting 2.1 Prices 2.2 Employment and unemployment 2.3 Compensation and working conditions 2.4 Productivity 3 Statistical regions 4 See also 5 Footnotes 6 Further reading 7 External links History  edit  See also US labor law The Bureau of Labor was established in the Department of the Interior by the Bureau of Labor Act 23 Stat. 60, June 27, 1884, to collect information about employment and labor.

It became an independent sub-Cabinet department by the Department of Labor Act 25 Stat. 182, June 13, 1888. It was incorporated, as the Bureau of Labor, into the Department of Commerce and Labor by the Department of Commerce Act 32 Stat. 827, February 14, 1903. Finally, it was transferred to the Department of Labor in 1913 where it resides today. 7  8  The BLS is now headquartered in the Postal Square Building near the United States Capitol and Union Station . Since 1915, the BLS has published a journal, the Monthly Labor Review , with articles about the data and methodologies of labor statistics.
