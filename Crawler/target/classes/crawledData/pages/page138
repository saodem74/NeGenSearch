Academic career  edit  Ian Sommerville was a lecturer in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh , Scotland from 1975 to 1978 and at Strathclyde University , Glasgow from 197886. From 1986 to 2006, he was Professor of Software Engineering in the Computing Department at the University of Lancaster , and in April 2006 he joined the School of Computer Science at St Andrews University, where he taught courses in advanced software engineering and critical systems engineering . He retired in January 2014 and since continues to do software-related things that he finds interesting. 4  Ian Sommervilles research work, partly funded by the EPSRC 5  has included systems requirements engineering and system evolution. A major focus has been system dependability , including the use of social analysis techniques such as ethnography to better understand how people and computers deliver dependability. He was a partner in the DIRC Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration in Dependability consortium, 6  which focused on dependable systems design and is now 2006 working on the related INDEED Interdisciplinary Design and Evaluation of Dependability project. He has also been a member of the board of advisors to the IEEE SWEBOK project. 7  He has worked on a number of European projects involving collaboration between academia and commercial enterprises, such as the ESPRIT project REAIMS Requirements Engineering adaptation and improvement for safety and dependability. Public activities  edit  In 2006, Ian Sommerville was one of 23 academics in the computer field who wrote open letters calling for an independent audit of the British National Health Service s proposed Programme for IT NPfIT and expressing concern about the GBP 12.4 billion programme. 8  9  10  Publications  edit  Most widely read of Sommervilles publications is probably his student text book  Software Engineering , currently in its 10th edition 1  along with other textbooks 11  12  Sommerville has also authored or co-authored numerous peer reviewed articles, papers. 2  3  References  edit   a b Sommerville, Ian 2011.
