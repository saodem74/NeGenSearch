Contents 1 Life 2 Definition of software engineering 3 Awards 4 Publications 5 References 6 External links Life  edit  Bauer earned his Abitur in 1942 and served in the Wehrmacht during World War II, from 1943 to 1945. From 1946 to 1950, he studied mathematics and theoretical physics at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitt in Munich . Bauer received his doctorate under the supervision of Fritz Bopp for his thesis Gruppentheoretische Untersuchungen zur Theorie der Spinwellengleichungen Group-theoretic investigations of the theory of spin wave equations in 1952. He completed his habilitation ber quadratisch konvergente Iterationsverfahren zur Lsung von algebraischen Gleichungen und Eigenwertproblemen On quadratically convergent iteration methods for solving algebraic equations and eigenvalue problems in 1954 at the Technical University of Munich . After teaching as privatdozent at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitt from 1954 to 1958, he became extraordinary professor for applied mathematics at the University of Mainz . Since 1963, he worked as a professor of mathematics and since 1972 computer science at Technical University of Munich. He retired in 1989. 1  Bauers early work involved the construction of computing machinery e.g. the logical relay computer STANISLAUS from 1951-1955 2  . In this context, he was the first to propose the widely used stack method of expression evaluation. Bauer also worked in the committees that developed the imperative computer programming languages ALGOL 58 and its successor ALGOL 60 , important predecessors to all modern imperative programming languages. In 1968, Bauer coined the term Software Engineering which has been in widespread use since. Bauer was an influential figure in establishing computer science as an independent subject in German universities. His scientific contributions spread from numerical analysis  BauerFike theorem  and fundamentals of interpretation and translation of programming languages, to his later works on systematics of program development, especially program transformation methods and systems  CIP-S  and the associated wide-spectrum language system CIP-L . He also wrote a well-respected book on cryptology , Decrypted secrets , now in its fourth edition. He was the doctoral advisor of 39 students, including Manfred Broy , David Gries , Manfred Paul , Gerhard Seegmller , Josef Stoer , Peter Wynn , and Christoph Zenger . Friedrich Bauer was married to Hildegard Bauer-Vogg. He was the father of three sons and two daughters. Definition of software engineering  edit  Bauer was a colleague of the German Representative the NATO Science Committee. In 1967, NATO had been discussing The Software Crisis and Bauer had suggested the term Software Engineering as a way to conceive of both the problem and the solution. 3  In 1972, Bauer published the following definition of software engineering Establishment and use of sound engineering principles to economically obtain software that is reliable and works on real machines efficiently. 4  Awards  edit  1944 Iron Cross 2nd Class 1968 Member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in mathematics and science class 1971 Bavarian Order of Merit 1978 Wilhelm Exner Medal Austria. 5  1982 Federal Merit Cross 1st Class 1984 Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina 1986 Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art 1987 Honorary Member of the Society for computer science 1988 Golden Ring of Honour of the German Museum 1988 IEEE Computer Pioneer Award 1997 Heinz-Maier-Leibnitz Medal from the Technical University of Munich 1998 corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences 2002 Honorary Member of the Deutsches Museum 2004 Silver Medal of Merit of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences Namesake of the Friedrich L.
