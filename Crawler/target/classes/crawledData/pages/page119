Work  edit  Entity-relationship modeling and conceptual data modeling  edit  The entity-relationship model serves as the foundation of many systems analysis and design methodologies, computer-aided software engineering CASE tools, and repository systems. The ER model is the basis for IBM s Repository ManagerMVS and DEC s CDDPlus . Chens original paper 2  is commonly cited as the definitive reference for entity relationship modeling though the concept of object relationship had been developed a year earlier by Schmid and Swenson as reported in the 1975 ACM SIGMOD Proceedings 1 . Chen is one of the pioneers of using the entity relationship concepts in software and information system modeling and design. Before Chens paper, the basic entity relationship ideas were used mostly informally by practitioners. Chen first published an abstract and presented his ER model in the First Very Large Database Conference in September 1975, the same year of a paper w ith similar concepts written by A. P. G. Brown. 11  Chens main contributions are formalizing the concepts, developing a theory with a set of data definition and manipulation operations, and specifying the translation rules from the ER model to several major types of databases including the Relational Database . He also popularized the model and introduced it to the academic literature. The ER model was adopted as the meta model ANSI Standard in Information Resource Directory System IRDS, and the ER approach has been ranked at the top methodology for database design and one of the top methodologies in systems development by several surveys of Fortune 500 companies. 12  Computer-aided software engineering  edit  Chens work is a cornerstone of software engineering, 12  in particular Computer-Aided Software Engineering CASE. In the late 80s and early 90s, IBMs Application Development Cycle ADCycle framework and DB2 repository RMMVS were based on the ER model. Other vendors repository systems such as Digitals CDD were also based on the ER model. Chen has had a significant impact on the CASE industry through his research and his lecturing around the world on structured system development methodologies. The ER model has influenced most of the major CASE tools , including Computer Associates  ERWIN, Oracle Corporation s Designer2000, and Sybase s PowerDesigner and even a general drawing tool like Microsoft Visio , as well as the IDEF1X standard. 12  The ER model is also the basis for Microsofts ADO.NET Entity Framework . The hypertext concept, which makes the World Wide Web extremely popular, is very similar to the main concept in the ER model. Chen investigated this linkage as an invited expert of several XML working groups of the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C . The ER model also serves as the foundation of some of the recent work on Object-oriented analysis and design methodologies and Semantic Web . The UML modeling language has its roots in the ER model. Computer performance modeling  edit  In his early career, he was active in R D activities in computer system performance. He was the program chair of an ACM SIGMETRICS conference. He developed a computer performance model for a major computer vendor. His innovative research results were adopted in commercial computer performance tuning and capacity planning tools. Memory and storage hierarchy, storage technology, CD-ROM, firmware, and micro-programming  edit  His Ph.D. thesis at Harvard was one of the first studies of cost-performance optimization models of multi-level memorystorage hierarchies. He was also one of the early micro-programmers developing the firmware for a file control unit for an IBM mainframe computer. His article on CD-ROM in IEEE Proceedings journal in the 80s was one of the first articles explaining how CD-R OM worked when CD-ROMs became popular. He was a co-author of the storage technology article in early versions of a computer encyclopedia book published by McGraw-Hill. Cyber security and terrorist detection  edit  In recent years, he led a multidisciplinary research team in developing new efficient and effective techniques in identifying terrorists and malicious cyber transactions. At CMU, he is active in the R D activities of CERT Coordination Center and Software Engineering Institute SEI. Big Data, Web Services, Blockchain  Internet of Things IoT  edit  He is active in research and lecturing on Big Data and emerging technologies. He was a keynote speaker and a keynote panelist on Big Data at IEEE Conferences. He was the 2014 Program Chair, the 2015-16 Conference Chair, and 2017 Honorary Chair of the IEEE BigData Congresses. He is the Chair of 2018 IEEE ICWS Conference and the Chair of Blockchain Panel. He is the General Chai r of 2019 IEEE Service Congress, Milan, Italy. Publications  edit  Peter P.
