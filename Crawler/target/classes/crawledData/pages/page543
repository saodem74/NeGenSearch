Risk register From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search A Risk register plots the impact of a given risk over of its probability. The presented example deals with some issues which can arise on a usual Saturday-night party. A risk register  PRINCE2  is a scatterplot used as risk management tool and to fulfill regulatory compliance acting as a repository for all risks identified and includes additional information about each risk, e.g. nature of the risk, reference and owner, mitigation measures. ISO 732009 Risk managementVocabulary 1  defines a risk register to be a record of information about identified risks.

There are recommendations for Risk Register content made by the Project Management Institute Body of Knowledge  PMBOK  and PRINCE2 . ISO 310002009 3  does not use the term risk register, however it does state that risks need to be documented. There are many different tools that can act as risk registers from comprehensive software suites to simple spreadsheets. The effectiveness of these tools depends on their implementation and the organisations culture.  citation needed  A typical risk register contains A risk category to group similar risks The risk breakdown structure identification number A brief description or name of the risk to make the risk easy to discuss The impact or consequence  if event actually occurs rated on an integer scale The probability or likelihood of its occurrence rated on an integer scale The Risk Score or Risk Rating  is the multiplication of Probability and Impact and is often used to rank the risks. Common mitigation steps e.g. within IT projects are Identify, Analyze, Plan Response, Monitor and Control. The risk register is called  qualitative if the probabilities are estimated by ranking them, as high to low impact. It is called  quantitative  both the impact and the probability is put into numbers, e.g. a risk might have a 1m impact and a 50 probability. Contingent response - the actions to be taken should the risk event actually occur. Contingency - the budget allocated to the contingent response Trigger - an event that itself results in the risk event occurring for example the risk event might be flooding and heavy rainfall the trigger Criticism  edit  Although risk registers are commonly used tools not only in projects and programs but also in companies, research has found that they can lead to dysfunctions, for instance Toyotas risk register listed reputation risks caused by Prius malfunctions but the company failed to take action. 4  Risk registers often lead to ritualistic decision-making, 4  illusion of control , 5  and the fallacy of misplaced concreteness mistaking the map for the territory. 6  However, if used with common sense risk registers are a useful tool to stimulate cross-functional debate and cooperation. 6  See also  edit  Risk Event chain methodology Risk Breakdown Structure Risk management tools Issue log Failure mode and effects analysis Failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis References  edit   httpwww.iso.orgisocatalogue_detailcsnumber44651  Kokcharov I.
