It is locally still known as Polytechnikum , or simply as Poly , derived from the original name eidgenssische polytechnische Schule , 11  which translates to  federal polytechnic school . ETH is a federal institute i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government, whereas the University of Zurich is a cantonal institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time the liberals pressed for a federal university, while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had. 12  In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zurich. From 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of Jrme Franel , the course program of ETH was restructured to that of a real university and ETH was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909 the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule . In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments. Interior skylights in the main building ETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes form the  ETH Domain  with the aim of collaborating on scientific projects. 13  Reputation and ranking  edit  University rankings Global ARWU World 14  19 THE World 16  10 QS World 15  7 ETH Zurich is ranked among the top universities in the world. Typically, popular rankings place the institution as the best university in continental Europe and ETH Zurich is consistently ranked among the top 1-5 universities in Europe, and among the top 3-10 best universities of the world. Historically, ETH Zurich has achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of chemistry , mathematics and physics . There are 32 Nobel Laureates who are associated with ETH. The most recent Nobel Laureate is Richard F. Heck who was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2010. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus. 17  In 2018, the QS World University Rankings placed ETH Zurich at 7th overall in the world. 18  In 2015, ETH was ranked 5th in the world in Engineering, Science and Technology, just behind the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Stanford University , Cambridge University and National University of Singapore . In 2015, ETH also ranked 6th in the world in Natural Sciences, and in 2016 ranked 1st in the world for Earth  Marine Sciences for the second consecutive year. 19  In 2016, Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked ETH Zurich 9th overall in the world and 8th in the world in the field of Engineering  Technology, just behind the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Stanford University , California Institute of Technology , Princeton University , Cambridge University , Imperial College London and Oxford University . 20  In a comparison of Swiss universities by swissUP Ranking and in rankings published by CHE comparing the universities of German-speaking countries, ETH Zurich traditionally is ranked first in natural sciences, computer science and engineering sciences. In the survey CHE ExcellenceRanking on the quality of Western European graduate school programmes in the fields biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, ETH was assessed as one of the three institutions to have excellent graduate programmes in all considered fields, the other two being the Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge . ETH Zurich had a total budget of 1.885 billion CHF 2  in the year 2017.

Like every public university in Switzerland, ETH is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the Matura . 21  Applicants from foreign countries are required to take either the reduced entrance exam or the comprehensive entrance exam although some applicants from several European countries are exempted from this rule. An applicant can be admitted to ETH even without any verifiable educational records by passing the comprehensive entrance exam . 22  As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Examinations are often held during examination sessions which are immediately before the beginning of the next semester only a few select courses offer an exam immediately after the semester ends. After the first year of study, bachelor students must pass a block examination of all courses taken in the first year, called the Basisprfung . If the weighted average score is not sufficient, a student is required to retake the entire Basisprfung which usually means having to re-sit the whole first year. About 50 of the students fail the Basisprfung on the first try and many of them choose to drop out of the course instead of repeating the Basisprfung . The structure of examinations in higher academic years is similar to the Basisprfung Basis examination, but with a higher success rate. The regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the Bachelor of Science degree and three or four further semesters for the Master of Science degree. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis. Education at ETH Zurich generally focuses more on theoretical aspects than application and most degree programs contain a high amount of mathematical training . The main language of instruction in undergraduate Bachelor studies is German and for admission a proof of sufficient knowledge of the German language is required for Bachelor students. 23  Most Masters programmes and doctoral studies are in English.

The main building was constructed 18581864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but nowadays it is located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, the ETH spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. As a result, the Zentrum campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout Zrich and firmly integrates the ETH in the city. The main building stands directly across the street from the University Hospital of Zurich and the University of Zurich . Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the Hnggerberg on a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003 since then, the Hnggerberg location houses the departments of architecture , civil engineering , biology , chemistry , materials science and physics . Main building  edit  Main building as seen from Polyterrasse ETH Zurich at night. The main building of ETH was built from 1858 to 1864 under Gustav Zeuner  the architect, however, was Gottfried Semper , who was a professor of architecture at ETH at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a neoclassical style that was unique to him and the namesake and architect of the Semperoper in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of Andrea Palladio and Donato Bramante . During the construction of the University of Zrich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed 19121914. At about the same time, Sempers ETH building was enlarged and received its impressive cupola . Science City  edit  In the year of ETH Zurichs 150th anniversary, an extensive project called Science City for the Hnggerberg Campus was started with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability. ETH Hnggerberg from the south, looking at the five fingers of the HCI and behind the high HPP building. In September 2014 a new project to connect Science City by train was published. 24  ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics  edit  The ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics LIB is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in accelerator mass spectrometry AMS and the use of ion beam based techniques with applications in archeology , earth sciences , life sciences , material sciences and fundamental physics . An example of such application is the tracing of isotopes and the detection of rare radionuclides with radiocarbon dating and the use of techniques such as Rutherford backscattering spectrometry or elastic recoil detection . 25  The LIB is developing the next generation of AMS machines. It is also a laboratory available for users interested in applying the techniques of ion beam analysis. 26  Student life  edit  ETH students were found to be the busiest students of all institutions of higher education in Switzerland. 27  The undergraduates tight curriculum consists of as much as twice the number of lectures as comparable courses of other Swiss universities.  citation needed  ETH has well over 100 student associations. Most notable is the VSETH  Verband der Studierenden an der ETH  which comprises all department associations. The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zrich are well-attended by ETH students and vice versa. The VSETH organizes events of greater public attention, such as the Polyball , the Polyparty does not exist any more and the Erstsemestrigenfest , the first two housed in the main building of ETH. Sometimes, the annual Erstsemestrigenfest takes place at extraordinary locations, for example the Zurich Airport . All freshmen enjoy special treatment at that event. Some of the notable associations that are not affiliated with a specific department are the ETH Entrepreneur Club and ETH Model United Nations. Both organisations enjoy high international standings and are regularly awarded for excellence in their field.  citation needed  ETH Juniors is another student run organisation. It forms a bridge between the industry and ETH and offers many services for students and companies alike. 28  The Academic Sports Association of Zrich ASVZ offers more than 120 sports. 29  The biggest annual sports event is the SOLA-Stafette SOLA relay race which consists of 14 sections over a total distance of 140 kilometers. More than 760 teams participated in the 2009 edition. 30  The 40th edition of the SOLA, held on May 4, 2013, had 900 enrolled teams, of which 893 started and 876 were classified. 31  In 2014 ASVZ celebrated their 75th anniversary. 32  Traditions  edit  The annual Polyball is the most prestigious public event at ETH, with a long tradition since the 1880s. The end of November, the Polyball welcomes around 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers in the extensively decorated main building of ETH. The Polyball is the biggest decorated ball in Europe. The amicable rivalry between ETH and the neighbouring University of Zrich has been cultivated since 1951 Uni-Poly. There has been an annual rowing match between teams from the two institutions on the river Limmat . There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH, most notably the annual Wolfgang Pauli Lectures , in honor of former ETH Professor Wolfgang Pauli . Distinct lecturers, among them 24 Nobel Laureates , have held lectures of the various fields of natural sciences at this conference since 1962.
