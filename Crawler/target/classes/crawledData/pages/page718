Hello, World program From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Hello world program  Jump to navigation Jump to search Traditional beginners computer program Hello World redirects here. For other uses, see Hello World disambiguation . A Hello, World message being displayed through long-exposure light painting with a moving strip of LED lights A Hello, World program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message Hello, World. Such a program is very simple in most programming languages , and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. 1  2  Contents 1 Purpose 2 History 3 Variations 4 Time to Hello World 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Purpose  edit  A Hello, World program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language. Hello, World is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it. History  edit  Hello, World program by Brian Kernighan 1978 While small test programs have existed since the development of programmable computers , the tradition of using the phrase Hello, World as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal 1978 book The C Programming Language . 3   disputed for in this source it is clear that the phrase exists from before    discuss  The example program in that book prints  hello, world , and was inherited from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan , Programming in C A Tutorial  4  main   printf hello, worldn   The C language version was preceded by Kernighans own 1972 A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B , 5  where the first known version of the program is found in an example used to illustrate external variables main   extern a, b, c putchara putcharb putcharc putcharn  a hell b o, w c orld The program prints hello, world on the terminal, including a newline character. The phrase is divided into multiple variables because in B, a character constant is limited to four ASCII characters. The previous example in the tutorial printed hi on the terminal, and the phrase hello,  world was introduced as a slightly longer greeting that required several character constants for its expression. The Jargon File claims that hello, world originated instead with BCPL 1967. 6   unreliable source  This claim is supported by the archived notes of the inventors of BCPL, Prof. Brian Kernighan at Princeton and Martin Richards at Cambridge.  citation needed  For modern languages, hello, world programs vary in sophistication. For example, the Go programming language introduced a multilingual program, 7  Sun demonstrated a Java hello, world based on scalable vector graphics , 8  and the XL programming language features a spinning Earth hello, world using 3D graphics. 9  While some languages such as Perl , Python or Ruby may need only a single statement to print hello, world, a low-level assembly language may require dozens of commands. Mark Guzdial and Elliot Soloway have suggested that the hello, world test message may be outdated now that graphics and sound can be manipulated as easily as text. 10  Variations  edit  A Hello, world program running on Sonys PlayStation Portable as a proof of concept. There are many variations on the punctuation and casing of the phrase. Variations include the presence or absence of the comma and exclamation mark, and the capitalization of the H, both the H and the W, or neither. Some languages are forced to implement different forms, such as HELLO WORLD, on systems that support only capital letters, while many hello, world program s in esoteric languages print out a slightly modified string. For example, the first non-trivial Malbolge program printed HEllO WORld, this having been determined to be good enough . 11  There are variations in spirit, as well. Functional programming languages, like Lisp , ML and Haskell , tend to substitute a factorial program for Hello, World, as functional programming emphasizes recursive techniques, whereas the original examples emphasize IO, which violates the spirit of pure functional programming by producing side effects. Languages otherwise capable of Hello, World Assembly, C, VHDL  may also be used in embedded systems , where text output is either difficult requiring additional components or communication with another computer or nonexistent. For devices such as microcontrollers , field-programmable gate arrays , and CPLD s, Hello, World may thus be substituted with a blinking LED , which demonstrates timing and interaction between components. 12  13  14  15  16  The Debian and Ubuntu Linux distributions provide the hello, world program through the apt packaging system this allows users to simply type apt-get install hello for the program to be installed, along with any software dependencies . While of itself useless, it serves as a sanity check and a simple example to newcomers of how to install a package. It is significantly more useful for developers, however, as it provides an example of how to create a .deb package, either traditionally or using debhelper, and the version of hello used, GNU Hello , serves as an example of how to write a GNU program. 17  Time to Hello World  edit  Time to Hello World TTHW is a metric for the time to create from scratch a Hello World program in a given programming language and run it. 18  See also  edit  Computer Science portal Computer programming portal 99 Bottles of Beer as used in computer science Foobar Java Pet Store Just another Perl hacker List of basic computer science topics Trabb Pardo-Knuth algorithm References  edit   James A Langbridge.
