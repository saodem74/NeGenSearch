Elastomers are amorphous polymers maintained above their glass transition temperature , so that considerable molecular reconformation , without breaking of covalent bonds , is feasible. At ambient temperatures , such rubbers are thus relatively soft  E  3  M Pa  and deformable. Their primary uses are for seals , adhesives and molded flexible parts. Application areas for different types of rubber are manifold and cover segments as diverse as tires, soles for shoes , and damping and insulating elements. The importance of these rubbers can be judged from the fact that global revenues are forecast to rise to US56 billion in 2020. 4  5  IUPAC defines the term elastomer by  Polymer that displays rubber-like elasticity. 6  Manufacturers of Elastomeric parts include NoProto, PrintForm, 3D Systems, and Afformativ. Rubber-like solids with elastic properties are called elastomers. Polymer chains are held together in these materials by relatively weak intermolecular bonds , which permit the polymers to stretch in response to macroscopic stresses. Natural rubber , neoprene rubber , buna-s and buna-n are all examples of such elastomers. Background  edit  A is an unstressed polymer B is the same polymer under stress. When the stress is removed, it will return to the A configuration. The dots represent cross-links Elastomers are usually thermosets requiring vulcanization  but may also be thermoplastic see thermoplastic elastomer . The long polymer chains cross-link during curing, i.e., vulcanizing. The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a spaghetti and meatball structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The elasticity is derived from the ability of the long chains to reconfigure themselves to distribute an applied stress. The covalent cross-linkages ensure that the elastomer will return to its original conf iguration when the stress is removed. As a result of this extreme flexibility, elastomers can reversibly extend from 5700, depending on the specific material. Without the cross-linkages or with short, uneasily reconfigured chains, the applied stress would result in a permanent deformation. Temperature effects are also present in the demonstrated elasticity of a polymer. Elastomers that have cooled to a glassy or crystalline phase will have less mobile chains, and consequentially less elasticity, than those manipulated at temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature of the polymer. It is also possible for a polymer to exhibit elasticity that is not due to covalent cross-links, but instead for thermodynamic reasons .
