It may be the hardware or the operating system OS, even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces , or other underlying software, as long as the program code is executed with it. Computing platforms have different abstraction levels, including a computer architecture , an OS, or runtime libraries . 2  A computing platform is the stage on which computer programs can run. A platform can be seen both as a constraint on the software development process , in that different platforms provide different functionality and restrictions and as an assistance to the development process, in that they provide low-level functionality ready-made. For example, an OS may be a platform that abstracts the underlying differences in hardware and provides a generic command for saving files or accessing the network .

Embedded systems can access hardware directly, without an OS this is referred to as running on  bare metal . A browser in the case of web-based software. The browser itself runs on a hardwareOS platform, but this is not relevant to software running within the browser. 3  An application, such as a spreadsheet or word processor, which hosts software written in an application-specific scripting language , such as an Excel macro . This can be extended to writing fully-fledged applications with the Microsoft Office suite as a platform. 4  Software frameworks that provide ready-made functionality. Cloud computing and Platform as a Service . Extending the idea of a software framework, these allow application developers to build software out of components that are hosted not by the developer, but by the provider, with internet communication linking them together. 5  The social networking sites Twitter and Facebook are also considered development platforms. 6  7  A virtual machine VM such as the Java virtual machine or .NET CLR . Applications are compiled into a format similar to machine code, known as bytecode , which is then executed by the VM. A virtualized version of a complete system, including virtualized hardware, OS, software, and storage. These allow, for instance, a typical Windows program to run on what is physically a Mac. Some architectures have multiple layers, with each layer acting as a platform to the one above it. In general, a component only has to be adapted to the layer immediately beneath it. For instance, a Java program has to be written to use the Java virtual machine JVM and associated libraries as a platform but does not have to be adapted to run for the Windows, Linux or Macintos h OS platforms. However, the JVM, the layer beneath the application, does have to be built separately for each OS. 8  Operating system examples  edit  Further information List of operating systems Desktop, laptop, server  edit  AmigaOS , AmigaOS 4 FreeBSD , NetBSD , OpenBSD IBM i Linux Microsoft Windows OpenVMS Classic Mac OS macOS OS2 Solaris Tru64 UNIX VM QNX zOS Mobile  edit  Android , a popular mobile operating system Android Bada BlackBerry OS Firefox OS iOS Embedded Linux Palm OS Symbian Tizen WebOS LuneOS Windows Mobile Windows Phone Software frameworks  edit  Further information Software framework Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW Cocoa Cocoa Touch Common Language Infrastructure CLI Mono .NET Framework Silverlight Flash AIR GNU Java platform Java ME Java SE Java EE JavaFX JavaFX Mobile LiveCode Microsoft XNA Mozilla Prism , XUL and XULRunner Open Web Platform Oracle Database Qt SAP NetWeaver Shockwave Smartface Universal Windows Platform Windows Runtime Vexi Hardware examples  edit  Further information Lists of computers Ordered roughly, from more common types to less common types Commodity computing platforms Wintel , that is, Intel x86 or compatible personal computer hardware with Windows operating system Macintosh , custom Apple Inc. hardware and Classic Mac OS and macOS operating systems, originally 68k -based, then PowerPC -based, now migrated to x86 ARM architecture based mobile devices iPhone smartphones and iPad tablet computers devices running iOS , also from Apple Gumstix or Raspberry Pi full function miniature computers with Linux Newton devices running the Newton OS , also from Apple x86 with Unix-like systems such as Linux or BSD variants CPM computers based on the S-100 bus , maybe the earliest microcomputer platform Video game consoles , any variety  PlayStation , Xbox , Nintendo  3DO Interactive Multiplayer , that was licensed to manufacturers Apple Pippin , a multimedia player platform for video game console development RISC processor based machines running Unix variants SPARC architecture computers running Solaris or illumos operating systems DEC Alpha cluster running OpenVMS or Tru64 UNIX Midrange computers with their custom operating systems, such as IBM OS400 Mainframe computers with their custom operating systems, such as IBM zOS Supercomputer architectures See also  edit  Cross-platform Platform virtualization Third platform References  edit   What I Talk About When I Talk About Platforms . martinfowler.com .
