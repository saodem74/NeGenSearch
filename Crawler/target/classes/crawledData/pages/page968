Russells paradox From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Russell paradox  Jump to navigation Jump to search Paradox in the foundations of mathematics Part of a series on Bertrand Russell Russell in 1916 Views on philosophy Views on society Russells paradox Russells teapot Theory of descriptions Logical atomism v t e In the foundations of mathematics , Russells paradox also known as Russells antinomy , discovered by Bertrand Russell in 1901, 1  2  showed that some attempted formalizations of the nave set theory created by Georg Cantor led to a contradiction . The same paradox had been discovered in 1899 by Ernst Zermelo 3  but he did not publish the idea, which remained known only to David Hilbert , Edmund Husserl , and other members of the University of Gttingen . At the end of the 1890s Cantor himself had already realized that his definition would lead to a contradiction, which he told Hilbert and Richard Dedekind by letter. 4  According to naive set theory, any definable collection is a set . Let R be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. If R is not a member of itself, then its definition dictates that it must contain itself, and if it contains itself, then it contradicts its own definition as the set of all sets that are not members of themselves. This contradiction is Russells paradox. Symbolically Let   R   x  x  x  , then   R  R  R  R displaystyle textLet Rxmid xnot in xtext, then Rin Riff Rnot in R In 1908, two ways of avoiding the paradox were proposed, Russells type theory and the Zermelo set theory , the first constructed axiomatic set theory . Zermelos axioms went well beyond Gottlob Frege s axioms of extensionality and unlimited set abstraction , and evolved into the now-standard ZermeloFraenkel set theory ZFC. The essential difference between Russells and Zermelos solution to the paradox is that Zermelo altered the axioms of set theory while preserving the logical language in which they are expressed the language of ZFC, with the help of Thoralf Skolem , turned out to be first-order logic  while Russell altered the logical language itself. 5  Contents 1 Informal presentation 2 Formal presentation 3 Set-theoretic responses 4 History 5 Applied versions 6 Applications and related topics 6.1 Russell-like paradoxes 7 Related paradoxes 8 See also 9 Notes 10 References 11 External links Informal presentation  edit  Most sets which one commonly encounters are not members of themselves. For example, take the set of all squares in the plane . That set is not itself a square in the plane, and therefore is not a member of itself. Let us call a set normal if it is not a member of itself, and abnormal if it is a member of itself. The set of squares in the plane is normal. On the other hand, the complementary set that contains everything which is not a square in the plane is itself not a square in the plane, and so should be one of its own members and is therefore abnormal. Now we consider the set of all normal sets, R , and try to determine whether R is normal or abnormal. If R were normal, it would be contained in the set of all normal sets itself, and therefore be abnormal on the other hand if R were abnormal, it would not be contained in the set of all normal sets itself, and therefore be normal. This leads to the conclusion that R is neither normal nor abnormal Russells paradox. Formal presentation  edit  Define Naive Set Theory NST as the theory of predicate logic with a binary predicate  displaystyle in  and the following axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension   y  x  x  y    x   displaystyle exists yforall xxin yiff varphi x for any formula  displaystyle varphi  with only the variable x free. Substitute x  x displaystyle xnotin x for   x  displaystyle varphi x . Then by existential instantiation reusing the symbol y  and universal instantiation we have y  y  y  y displaystyle yin yiff ynotin y a contradiction. Therefore, NST is inconsistent . 6  Set-theoretic responses  edit  In 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed an axiomatization of set theory that avoided the paradoxes of naive set theory by replacing arbitrary set comprehension with weaker existence axioms, such as his axiom of separation  Aussonderung . Modifications to this axiomatic theory proposed in the 1920s by Abraham Fraenkel , Thoralf Skolem , and by Zermelo himself resulted in the axiomatic set theory called ZFC . This theory became widely accepted once Zermelos axiom of choice ceased to be controversial, and ZFC has remained the canonical axiomatic set theory down to the present day. ZFC does not assume that, for every property, there is a set of all things satisfying that property. Rather, it asserts that given any set X , any subset of X definable using first-order logic exists. The object R discussed above cannot be constructed in this fashion, and is therefore not a ZFC set. In some extensions of ZFC , objects like R are called proper classes . ZFC is silent about types, although the cumulative hierarchy has a notion of layers that resemble types. Zermelo himself never accepted Skolems formulation of ZFC using the language of first-order logic. As Jos Ferreirs notes, Zermelo insisted instead that propositional functions conditions or predicates used for separating off subsets, as well as the replacement functions, can be entirely arbitrary ganz beliebig  the modern interpretation given to this statement is that Zermelo wanted to include higher-order quantification in order to avoid Skolems paradox . Around 1930, Zermelo also introduced apparently independently of von Neumann, the axiom of foundation , thusas Ferreirs observes by forbidding circular and ungrounded sets, it ZFC incorporated one of the crucial motivations of TT type theorythe principle of the types of arguments. This 2nd order ZFC preferred by Zermelo, including axiom of foundation, allowed a rich cumulative hierarchy. Ferreirs writes that Zermelos layers are essentially the same as the typ es in the contemporary versions of simple TT type theory offered by Gdel and Tarski. One can describe the cumulative hierarchy into which Zermelo developed his models as the universe of a cumulative TT in which transfinite types are allowed. Once we have adopted an impredicative standpoint, abandoning the idea that classes are constructed, it is not unnatural to accept tran sfinite types. Thus, simple TT and ZFC could now be regarded as systems that talk essentially about the same intended objects. The main difference is that TT relies on a strong higher-order logic, while Zermelo employed second-order logic, and ZFC can also be given a first-order formulation. The first-order description of the cumulative hierarchy is much weaker, as is show n by the existence of denumerable models Skolem paradox, but it enjoys some important advantages. 7  In ZFC, given a set A , it is possible to define a set B that consists of exactly the sets in A that are not members of themselves. B cannot be in A by the same reasoning in Russells Paradox. This variation of Russells paradox shows that no set contains everything. Through the work of Zermelo and others, especially John von Neumann , the structure of what some see as the natural objects described by ZFC eventually became clear they are the elements of the von Neumann universe , V , built up from the empty set by transfinitely iterating the power set operation. It is thus now possible again to reason about sets in a non-axiomatic fashion without running afoul of Russells paradox, namely by reasoning about the elements of V . Whether it is appropriate to think of sets in this way is a point of contention among the rival points of view on the philosophy of mathematics . Other resolutions to Russells paradox, more in the spirit of type theory , include the axiomatic set theories New Foundations and Scott-Potter set theory . History  edit  Russell discovered the paradox in May or June 1901. 8  By his own account in his 1919 Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy , he attempted to discover some flaw in Cantors proof that there is no greatest cardinal. 9  In a 1902 letter, 10  he announced the discovery to Gottlob Frege of the paradox in Freges 1879 Begriffsschrift and framed the problem in terms of both logic and set theory, and in particular in terms of Freges definition of function  a  b  .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 There is just one point where I have encountered a difficulty. You state p. 17 p. 23 above that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let w be the predicate to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can w be predicated of itself From each answer its opposite follows. Therefore we must conclude that w is not a predicate. Likewise there is no class as a totality of those classes which, each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection Menge does not form a totality. Russell would go on to cover it at length in his 1903 The Principles of Mathematics , where he repeated his first encounter with the paradox 11  Before taking leave of fundamental questions, it is necessary to examine more in detail the singular contradiction, already mentioned, with regard to predicates not predicable of themselves. ... I may mention that I was led to it in the endeavour to reconcile Cantors proof.... Russell wrote to Frege about the paradox just as Frege was preparing the second volume of his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik . 12  Frege responded to Russell very quickly his letter dated 22 June 1902 appeared, with van Heijenoorts commentary in Heijenoort 1967126127. Frege then wrote an appendix admitting to the paradox, 13  and proposed a solution that Russell would endorse in his Principles of Mathematics , 14  but was later considered by some to be unsatisfactory. 15  For his part, Russell had his work at the printers and he added an appendix on the doctrine of types . 16  Ernst Zermelo in his 1908 A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering published at the same time he published the first axiomatic set theory 17  laid claim to prior discovery of the antinomy in Cantors naive set theory. He states And yet, even the elementary form that Russell 9 gave to the set-theoretic antinomies could have persuaded them J. Knig, Jourdain, F. Bernstein that the solution of these difficulties is not to be sought in the surrender of well-ordering but only in a suitable restriction of the notion of set. 18  Footnote 9 is where he stakes his claim 9 1903 , pp. 366368. I had, however, discovered this antinomy myself, independently of Russell, and had communicated it prior to 1903 to Professor Hilbert among others . 19  Frege sent a copy of his Grundgesetze der Arithmetik to Hilbert as noted above, Freges last volume mentioned the paradox that Russell had communicated to Frege. After receiving Freges last volume, on 7 November 1903, Hilbert wrote a letter to Frege in which he said, referring to Russells paradox, I believe Dr. Zermelo discovered it three or four years ago. A written account of Zermelos actual argument was discovered in t he Nachlass of Edmund Husserl . 20  In 1923, Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed to dispose of Russells paradox as follows The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function Ffx could be its own argument in that case there would be a proposition FFfx , in which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form Ofx and the outer one has the form YOfx . Only the letter F is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of FFu we write do   FOu . Ou  Fu . That disposes of Russells paradox.  Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus , 3.333 Russell and Alfred North Whitehead wrote their three-volume Principia Mathematica hoping to achieve what Frege had been unable to do. They sought to banish the paradoxes of naive set theory by employing a theory of types they devised for this purpose. While they succeeded in grounding arithmetic in a fashion, it is not at all evident that they did so by purely logical means. While Principia Mathematica avoided the known paradoxes and allows the derivation of a great deal of mathematics, its system gave rise to new problems. In any event, Kurt Gdel in 193031 proved that while the logic of much of Principia Mathematica , now known as first-order logic , is complete , Peano arithmetic is necessarily incomplete if it is consistent . This is very widelythough not universallyregarded as having shown the logicist program of Frege to be impossible to complete. In 2001 A Centenary International Conference celebrating the first hundred years of Russells paradox was held in Munich and its proceedings have been published. 8  Applied versions  edit  There are some versions of this paradox that are closer to real-life situations and may be easier to understand for non-logicians. For example, the barber paradox supposes a barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves and only men who do not shave themselves. When one thinks about whether the barber should shave himself or not, the paradox begins to emerge. As another example, consider five lists of encyclopedia entries within the same encyclopedia List of articles about people Don Knotts Don Nix Emperor Knin Hermann Hesse Isaac Newton Nikola Tesla Ptolemy VII of Egypt Rainie Yang Sherlock Holmes Socrates List of articles starting with the letter L L LVE TV L H Leivonmki London ... List of articles starting with the letter K List of articles starting with the letter L itself OK List of articles starting with the letter M ... List of articles about places Asia Enoshima Germany Leivonmki Katase River List of articles about Japan Emperor Showa Enoshima Katase River Mount Fuji Tokyo List of all lists that do not contain themselves List of articles about Japan List of articles about people List of articles about places ... List of articles starting with the letter K List of articles starting with the letter M ... List of all lists that do not contain themselves If the List of all lists that do not contain themselves contains itself, then it does not belong to itself and should be removed. However, if it does not list itself, then it should be added to itself. While appealing, these layman s versions of the paradox share a drawback an easy refutation of the barber paradox seems to be that such a barber does not exist, or that the barber is a woman and therefore doesnt shave. The whole point of Russells paradox is that the answer such a set does not exist means the definition of the notion of set within a given theory is unsatisfactory. Note the difference b etween the statements such a set does not exist and it is an empty set . It is like the difference between saying There is no bucket and saying The bucket is empty. A notable exception to the above may be the GrellingNelson paradox , in which words and meaning are the elements of the scenario rather than people and hair-cutting. Though it is easy to refute the barbers paradox by saying that such a barber does not and cannot  exist, it is impossible to say something similar about a meaningfully defined word. One way that the paradox has been dramatised is as follows Suppose that every public library has to compile a catalogue of all its books. Since the catalogue is itself one of the librarys books, some librarians include it in the catalogue for completeness while others leave it out as it being one of the librarys books is self-evident. Now imagine that all these catalogues are sent to the national library. Some of them include themselves in their listings, others do not. The national librarian compiles two master cataloguesone of all the catalogues that list themselves, and one of all those that dont. The question is should these master catalogues list themselves The Catalogue of all catalogues that list themselves is no problem. If the librarian doesnt include it in its own listing, it remains a true catalogue of those catalogues that do include themselves. If the librarian does include it, it remains a true catalogue of those that list themselves. However, just as the librarian cannot go wrong with the first master catalogue, the librarian is doomed to fail with the second. When it comes to the Catalogue of all catalogues that dont list themselves, the librarian cannot include it in its own listing, because then it would include itself, and so belongs to the other catalogue, that of catalogues that do include themselves. However, if the librarian leaves it out, the catalogue is incomplete. Either way, it can never be a true master catalogue of catalogues that do not list themselves. Applications and related topics  edit  Russell-like paradoxes  edit  As illustrated above for the barber paradox, Russells paradox is not hard to extend. Take A transitive verb V , that can be applied to its substantive form. Form the sentence The V er that V s all and only those who dont V  themselves, Sometimes the all is replaced by all V ers. An example would be paint The paint er that paint s all and only those that dont paint themselves. or elect The elect or  representative , that elect s all that dont elect themselves. Paradoxes that fall in this scheme include The barber with shave . The original Russells paradox with contain The container Set that contains all containers that dont contain themselves. The GrellingNelson paradox with describer The describer word that describes all words, that dont describe themselves. Richards paradox with denote The denoter number that denotes all denoters numbers that dont denote themselves. In this paradox, all descriptions of numbers get an assigned number. The term that denotes all denoters numbers that dont denote themselves is here called Richardian .

The second volume of Gg., which appeared too late to be noticed in the Appendix, contains an interesting discussion of the contradiction pp. 253265, suggesting that the solution is to be found by denying that two propositional functions that determine equal classes must be equivalent. As it seems very likely that this is the true solution, the reader is strongly recommended to examine Freges argument on the point Russell 1903522 The abbreviation Gg. stands for Freges Grundgezetze der Arithmetik .

The conclusion appeared to be disastrous.... Livio 2009188. But van Heijenoort in his commentary before Freges 1902 Letter to Russell describes Freges proposed way out in some detailthe matter has to do with the  transformation of the generalization of an equality into an equality of courses-of-values. For Frege a function is something incomplete, unsaturated  this seems to contradict the contemporary notion of a function in extension see Freges wording at page 128 Incidentally, it seems to me that the expression a predicate is predicated of itself is not exact. ...Therefore I would prefer to say that a concept is predicated of its own extension etc. But he waffles at the end of his suggestion that a function-as-concept-in-extension can be written as predicated of its function. van Heijenoort cites Quine For a late and thorough study of Freges way out, see Quine 1955  On Freges way out, Mind 64 , 145159 reprinted in Quine 1955b  Appendix.
