He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award , informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer science. 4  5  He is the author of the multi-volume work The Art of Computer Programming . He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation . In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science , Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces. As a writer and scholar, Knuth created the WEB and CWEB computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate literate programming , and designed the MIX  MMIX instruction set architectures . Knuth strongly opposes granting software patents , having expressed his opinion to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation .

Although the judges only had 2,500 words on their list, Donald found 4,500 words, winning the contest. As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat. 8  7  Education  edit  In 1956, Knuth received a scholarship to the Case Institute of Technology now part of Case Western Reserve University  in Cleveland, Ohio. He also joined Beta Nu Chapter of the Theta Chi fraternity . While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the IBM 650 , one of the early mainframes . After reading the computers manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better. 9  In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his schools basketball team win their games. 10  He assigned values to players in order to gauge their probability of getting points, a novel approach that Newsweek and CBS Evening News later reported on. 9  Knuth was one of the founding editors of Case Institutes Engineering and Science Review , which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959. 11  He then switched from physics to mathematics, and in 1960 he received his bachelor of science degree, simultaneously being given a master of science degree by a special award of the faculty who considered his work exceptionally outstanding. 9  12  In 1963, with mathematician Marshall Hall as his adviser, 2  he earned a PhD in mathematics from the California Institute of Technology . 13  Early work  edit  After receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltechs faculty as an assistant professor. 14  He accepted a commission to write a book on computer programming language compilers . While working on this project, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became The Art of Computer Programming . He originally planned to publish this as a single book. As Knuth developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968. 15  Just before publishing the first volume of The Art of Computer Programming , Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the Institute for Defense Analyses Communications Research Division , then situated on the Princeton University campus, which was performing mathematical research in cryptography to support the National Security Agency . Knuth then left this position to join the Stanford University faculty in 1969 16  , where he is now Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus. 17  18  Writings  edit  Knuth is a writer, as well as a computer scientist. 14  Knuth has been called the father of the analysis of algorithms . 19  The Art of Computer Programming  TAOCP   edit  Main article The Art of Computer Programming In the 1970s, Knuth described computer science as a totally new field with no real identity. And the standard of available publications was not that high. A lot of the papers coming out were quite simply wrong.  ... So one of my motivations was to put straight a story that had been very badly told. 20  By 2011, the first three volumes and part one of volume four of his series had been published. 21  Concrete Mathematics A Foundation for Computer Science 2nd ed., which originated with an expansion of the mathematical preliminaries section of Volume 1 of TAoCP , has also been published. Bill Gates has praised the difficulty of the subject matter in The Art of Computer Programming , stating, If you think youre a really good programmer  ... You should definitely send me a rsum if you can read the whole thing. 22  Other works  edit  Knuth is also the author of Surreal Numbers , 23  a mathematical novelette on John Conway s set theory construction of an alternate system of numbers. Instead of simply explaining the subject, the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics. Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original, creative research. In 1995, Knuth wrote the foreword to the book AB by Marko Petkovek , Herbert Wilf and Doron Zeilberger . 24  Knuth is also an occasional contributor of language puzzles to Word Ways The Journal of Recreational Linguistics . 25  Knuth has also delved into recreational mathematics . He contributed articles to the Journal of Recreational Mathematics beginning in the 1960s, and was acknowledged as a major contributor in Joseph Madachy s Mathematics on Vacation . 26  Knuth has also appeared in a number of Numberphile 27  and Computerphile videos on YouTube where he has discussed topics from writing Surreal Numbers 28  to why he doesnt use email. 29  Works regarding Knuths religious beliefs  edit  In addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth, a Lutheran , 30  is also the author of 316 Bible Texts Illuminated , 31  in which he examines the Bible by a process of systematic sampling , namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book. Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of Hermann Zapf . Subsequently, he was invited to give a set of lectures on his 316 project, resulting in another book, Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About , where he published the lectures God and Computer Science . Opinion on software patents  edit  As a member of the academic and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting software patents for trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the interior-point method of linear programming . 32  He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation . 33  Computer Musings  edit  Knuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at Stanford University , which he titled Computer Musings. He was a visiting professor at the Oxford University Department of Computer Science in the United Kingdom until 2017 and an Honorary Fellow of Magdalen College . 34  35  Programming  edit  Digital typesetting  edit  In the 1970s the publishers of TAOCP abandoned Monotype in favor of phototypesetting . Knuth became so frustrated with the inability of the latter system to approach the quality of the previous volumes, which were typeset using the older system, that he took time out to work on digital typesetting and created TeX and Metafont . 36  Literate programming  edit  While developing TeX, Knuth created a new methodology of programming, which he called literate programming , because he believed that programmers should think of programs as works of literature. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do. 37  Knuth embodied the idea of literate programming in the WEB system. The same WEB source is used to weave a TeX file, and to tangle a Pascal source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, CWEB , replaces Pascal with C . Knuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books The TeXbook , which is originally published in 1984, and The METAFONTbook , which is originally published in 1986. 38  Around the same time, LaTeX , the now-widely-adopted macro package based on TeX, was first developed by Leslie Lamport , who later published its first user manual in 1986 39  . Personal life  edit  Donald Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961, while he was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology. They have two children John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth. 40  Chinese name  edit  Knuths Chinese name is Gao Dena  simplified Chinese    traditional Chinese    pinyin  Go d n . 41  3  In 1977, he was given this name by Frances Yao , shortly before making a 3-week trip to China . 3  42  In his 1980 volume of The Art of Computer Programming  simplified Chinese    traditional Chinese    pinyin  Jsunj chngx shj ysh , Knuth explains that he embraced his Chinese name because he wanted to be known by the growing numbers of computer programmers in China at the time. In 1989, his Chinese name was placed atop the Journal of Computer Science and Technology s header, which Knuth says makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language. 42  Health concerns  edit  In 2006, Knuth was diagnosed with prostate cancer . He underwent surgery in December that year and stated, a little bit of radiation therapy  ... as a precaution but the prognosis looks pretty good, as he reported in his video autobiography. 43  Humor  edit  One of Knuths reward checks Nested parens Donald Knuth on Jacob Appelbaum s shirt within the two parentheses, Jacob Appelbaum, and Donald Knuth Knuth used to pay a finders fee of 2.56 for any typographical errors or mistakes discovered in his books, because 256 pennies is one hexadecimal dollar, and 0.32 for valuable suggestions. According to an article in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Technology Review , these Knuth reward checks are among computerdoms most prized trophies. Knuth had to stop sending real checks in 2008 due to bank fraud, and instead now gives each error finder a certificate of deposit from a publicly listed balance in his fictitious Bank of San Serriffe . 44  He once warned a correspondent, Beware of bugs in the above code I have only proved it correct, not tried it. 3  Knuth published his first scientific article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures. In it, he defined the fundamental unit of length as the thickness of Mad No. 26, and named the fundamental unit of force whatmeworry. Mad published the article in issue No. 33 June 1957. 45  46  To demonstrate the concept of recursion , Knuth intentionally referred Circular definition and Definition, circular to each other in the index of The Art of Computer Programming , Volume 1 . The preface of Concrete Mathematics has the following paragraph .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 When DEK taught Concrete Mathematics at Stanford for the first time, he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft. He announced that, contrary to the expectations of his colleagues, he was not going to teach the Theory of Aggregates, nor Stones Embedding Theorem , nor even the Stoneech compactification . Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room. At the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced a satirical XML -based successor to TeX, titled iTeX  pronounced   itks , performed with a bell ringing, which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, 3D printing , input from seismographs and heart monitors, animation, and stereophonic sound. 47  48  49  Awards and honors  edit  In 1971, Knuth was the recipient of the first ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award . He has received various other awards including the Turing Award , the National Medal of Science , the John von Neumann Medal , and the Kyoto Prize . Knuth was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society DFBCS in 1980 in recognition of Knuths contributions to the field of computer science. In 1990 he was awarded the one-of-a-kind academic title of Professor of The Art of Computer Programming , which has since been revised to Professor Emeritus of The Art of Computer Programming . Knuth was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. In 1992, he became an associate of the French Academy of Sciences . Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at Stanford University in order to finish The Art of Computer Programming . He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ForMemRS in 2003 . 1  Knuth was elected as a Fellow first class of Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics. 50  He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters . 51  In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 52  Other awards and honors include First ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award , 1971 Turing Award , 1974 Lester R. Ford Award , 1975 53  and 1993 54  Josiah Willard Gibbs Lecturer , 1978 55  56  National Medal of Science , 1979 Franklin Medal , 1988 John von Neumann Medal , 1995 Harvey Prize from the Technion , 1995 57  Kyoto Prize , 1996 Fellow of the Computer History Museum for his fundamental early work in the history of computing algorithms, development of the TeX typesetting language, and for major contributions to mathematics and computer science. 1998 58  Asteroid 21656 Knuth , named in his honor in May 2001 59  60  Katayanagi Prize, 2010 61  BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the category of Information and Communication Technologies, 2010 62  Turing Lecture , 2011 Stanford University School of Engineering Hero Award, 2011 63  Gallery  edit  Knuth, March 4, 2005 Knuth in front of statue St. Mesrop Mashtots , Matenadaran , Yerevan , Armenia , June 9, 2006 Shustek, Russell, Alcorn, Knuth, Wozniak, Mathews, Allen, CHM 2011 Knuth and Steve Wozniak , CHM 2011 Publications  edit  A short list of his publications include 64  The Art of Computer Programming  .mw-parser-output .refbeginfont-size90margin-bottom0.5em.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indentsullist-style-typenonemargin-left0.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indentsulli,.mw-parser-output .refbegin-hanging-indentsdlddmargin-left0padding-left3.2emtext-indent-3.2emlist-stylenone.mw-parser-output .refbegin-100font-size100    1997.

I fondly hope that many Chinese computer programmers will learn to recognize my Chinese name Gao Dena, which was given to me by Francis Yao just before I visited your country in 1977. I still have very fond memories of that three-week visit, and I have been glad to see Gao Dena on the masthead of the Journal of Computer Science and Technology since 1989. This name makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language.  Donald Knuth 85  Coping with cancer . Web of Stories . April 2006 . Retrieved May 2, 2012 .
