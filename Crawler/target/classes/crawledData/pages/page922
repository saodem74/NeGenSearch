Garbage in, garbage out From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search In computer science , garbage in, garbage out  GIGO  describes the concept that flawed, or nonsense input data produces nonsense output or garbage. The specific phrase is accredited by FOLDOC to the late Wilf Hey , who is also accredited by FOLDOC for work in developing RPG while working at IBM in 1965. The principle also applies more generally to all analysis and logic , in that arguments are unsound if their premises are flawed.

The first use of the phrase has been dated to a November 10, 1957, syndicated newspaper article about US Army mathematicians and their work with early computers, 1  in which an Army Specialist named William D. Mellin explained that computers cannot think for themselves, and that sloppily programmed inputs inevitably lead to incorrect outputs. The underlying principle was noted by the inventor of the first programmable computing device design .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 On two occasions I have been asked, Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out  ... I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.  Charles Babbage , Passages from the Life of a Philosopher 2  More recently, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch comes to a similar conclusion A loading computer is an effective and useful tool for the safe running of a ship. However, its output can only be as accurate as the information entered into it.

Precisely for that reason, going behind that output is out of the question, even if one has good cause to be suspicious. In short, the computer analysis becomes a credible references point although based on poor data. 6  Uses  edit  The term can also be used as an explanation for the poor quality of a digitized audio or video file. Although digitizing can be the first step in cleaning up a signal, it does not, by itself, improve the quality. Defects in the original analog signal will be faithfully recorded, but might be identified and removed by a subsequent step by digital signal processing . GIGO is commonly used to describe failures in human decision-making due to faulty, incomplete, or imprecise data. This sort of issue predates the computer age, but the term can still be applied. GIGO was the name of a Usenet gateway program to FidoNet , MAUSnet, e.a. 7  In statistics , it is not possible to carry out an accurate statistical analysis of inaccurate data. 8  See also  edit  Look up garbage in, garbage out  or GIGO in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
