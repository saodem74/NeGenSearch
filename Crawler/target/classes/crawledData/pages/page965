Spaghetti code From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Pejorative phrase for source code that has a complex and tangled control structure reminiscent of spaghetti Spaghetti code is a pejorative phrase for unstructured and difficult-to- maintain source code . Spaghetti code can be caused by several factors, such as volatile project requirements, lack of programming style rules, and insufficient ability or experience. 1  Contents 1 Meaning 2 History 3 Related phrases 3.1 Ravioli code 3.2 Lasagna code 4 Examples 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Meaning  edit  Code that overuses GOTO statements rather than structured programming constructs, resulting in convoluted and unmaintainable programs, is often called spaghetti code. 2  Such code has a complex and tangled control structure , resulting in a program flow that is conceptually like a bowl of spaghetti , twisted and tangled. 3  In a 1980 publication by the United States National Bureau of Standards , the phrase spaghetti program was used to describe older programs having fragmented and scattered files. 4  Spaghetti code can also describe an anti-pattern in which object-oriented code is written in a procedural style, such as by creating classes whose methods are overly long and messy, or forsaking object oriented concepts like polymorphism . 5  The presence of this form of spaghetti code can significantly reduce the comprehensibility of a system. 6  History  edit  It is not clear when the phrase spaghetti code came into common usage however, several references appeared in 1977 including Macaroni is Better Than Spaghetti by Steele published in Proceedings of the 1977 symposium on artificial intelligence and programming languages. In the 1978 book A primer on disciplined programming using PLI, PLCS, and PLCT , Richard Conway used the term to describe types of programs that have the same clean logical structure as a plate of spaghetti, 7  a phrase repeated in the 1979 book An Introduction to Programming he co-authored with David Gries . 8  In the 1988 paper A spiral model of software development and enhancement , the term is used to describe the older practice of the code and fix model , which lacked planning and eventually led to the development of the waterfall model . 9  In the 1979 book Structured programming for the COBOL programmer , author Paul Noll uses the phrases spaghetti code and rats nest as synonyms to describe poorly structured source code. 10  In the Ada  Europe 93 conference, Ada was described as forcing the programmer to produce understandable, instead of spaghetti code, because of its restrictive exception propagation mechanism. 11  In a 1981 computer languages spoof in The Michigan Technic titled BASICally speaking...FORTRAN bytes, the author described FORTRAN as proof positive that the cofounders of IBM were Italian, for it consists entirely of spaghetti code. 12  Related phrases  edit  Ravioli code  edit  Ravioli code is a term specific to object-oriented programming . It describes code that comprises well-structured classes that are easy to understand in isolation, but difficult to understand as a whole. 13  Lasagna code  edit  Main articles Architectural layer and Layer object-oriented design Lasagna code refers to code whose layers are so complicated and intertwined that making a change in one layer would necessitate changes in all other layers. 14  Examples  edit  Here follows what would be considered a trivial example of spaghetti code in BASIC . The program prints each of the numbers 1 to 100 to the screen along with its square. Indentation is not used to differentiate the various actions performed by the code, and that the programs GOTO statements create a reliance on line numbers . The flow of execution from one area to another is harder to predict. Real-world occurrences of spaghetti code are more complex and can add greatly to a programs maintenance costs. 1 i  0 2 i  i  1 3 PRINT i  squared   i  i 4 IF i  100 THEN GOTO 6 5 GOTO 2 6 PRINT Program Completed.  7 END Here is the same code written in a structured programming style 1 FOR i  1 TO 100 2 PRINT i  squared   i  i 3 NEXT i 4 PRINT Program Completed.  5 END The program jumps from one area to another, but this jumping is formal and more easily predictable, because for loops and functions provide flow control whereas the goto statement encourages arbitrary flow control. Though this example is small, real world programs are composed of many lines of code and are difficult to maintain when written in a spaghetti code fashion. Here is another example of Spaghetti code with embedded GOTO statements.
