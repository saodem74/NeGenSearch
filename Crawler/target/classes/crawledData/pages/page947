Because of its high tensile strength and low cost, it is a major component used in buildings , infrastructure , tools , ships , automobiles , machines , appliances , and weapons . Iron is the base metal of steel. Iron is able to take on two crystalline forms allotropic forms, body centered cubic and face centered cubic , depending on its temperature. In the body-centered cubic arrangement, there is an iron atom in the center and eight atoms at the vertices of each cubic unit cell in the face-centered cubic, there is one atom at the center of each of the six faces of the cubic unit cell and eight atoms at its vertices. It is the interaction of the allotropes of iron with the alloying elements, primarily carbon, that gives steel and cast iron their range of unique properties. In pure iron, the crystal structure has relatively little resistance to the iron atoms slipping past one another, and so pure iron is quite ductile , or soft and easily formed. In steel, small amounts of carbon, other elements, and inclusions within the iron act as hardening agents that prevent the movement of dislocations . The carbon in typical steel alloys may contribute up to 2.14 of its weight. Varying the amount of carbon and many other alloying elements, as well as controlling their chemical and physical makeup in the final steel either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases, slows the movement of those dislocations that make pure iron ductile, and thus controls and enhances its qu alities. These qualities include the hardness , quenching behavior , need for annealing , tempering behavior , yield strength , and tensile strength of the resulting steel. The increase in steels strength compared to pure iron is possible only by reducing irons ductility. Steel was produced in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use began only after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the introduction of the blast furnace and production of crucible steel . This was followed by the open-hearth furnace and then the Bessemer process in England in the mid-19th century. With the invention of the Bessemer process, a new era of mass-produced steel began. Mild steel replaced wrought iron . Further refinements in the process, such as basic oxygen steelmaking BOS, largely replaced earlier methods by further lowering the cost of production and increasing the quality of the final product. Today, steel is one of the most common manmade materials in the world, with more than 1.6 billion tons produced annually. Modern steel is generally identified by various grades defined by assorted standards organizations .

In contrast, cast iron does undergo eutectic reaction. Too little carbon content leaves pure iron quite soft, ductile, and weak. Carbon contents higher than those of steel make a brittle alloy commonly called pig iron . While iron alloyed with carbon is called carbon steel, alloy steel is steel to which other alloying elements have been intentionally added to modify the characteristics of steel. Common alloying elements include manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum , boron , titanium , vanadium , tungsten, cobalt , and niobium . 3  Additional elements, most frequently considered undesirable, are also important in steel phosphorus , sulfur , silicon , and traces of oxygen , nitrogen , and copper . Plain carbon-iron alloys with a higher than 2.1 carbon content are known as cast iron . With modern steelmaking techniques such as powder metal forming, it is possible to make very high-carbon and other alloy material steels, but such are not common. Cast iron is not malleable even when hot, but it can be formed by casting as it has a lower melting point than steel and good castability properties. 3  Certain compositions of cast iron, while retaining the economies of melting and casting, can be heat treated after casting to make malleable iron or ductile iron objects. Steel is distinguishable from wrought iron now largely obsolete, which may contain a small amount of carbon but large amounts of slag . Material properties  edit  Iron-carbon equilibrium phase diagram , showing the conditions necessary to form different phases Iron is commonly found in the Earths crust in the form of an ore , usually an iron oxide, such as magnetite or hematite . Iron is extracted from iron ore by removing the oxygen through its combination with a preferred chemical partner such as carbon which is then lost to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. This process, known as smelting , was first applied to metals with lower melting points, such as tin , which melts at about 250  C 482  F, and copper , which melts at about 1,100  C 2,010  F, and the combination, bronze, which has a melting point lower than 1,083  C 1,981  F. In comparison, cast iron melts at about 1,375  C 2,507  F. 4  Small quantities of iron were smelted in ancient times, in the solid state, by heating the ore in a charcoal fire and then welding the clumps together with a hammer and in the process squeezing out the impurities. With care, the carbon content could be controlled by moving it around in the fire. Unlike copper and tin, liquid or solid iron dissolves carbon quite readily. All of these temperatures could be reached with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age . Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond 800  C 1,470  F, it is important that smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce iron oxides, results in an alloy  pig iron  that retains too much carbon to be called steel. 4  The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step. Other materials are often added to the ironcarbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue . 5  To inhibit corrosion, at least 11 chromium is added to steel so that a hard oxide forms on the metal surface this is known as stainless steel . Tungsten slows the formation of cementite , keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel . On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen , and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing. 5  The density of steel varies based on the alloying constituents but usually ranges between 7,750 and 8,050  kgm 3 484 and 503  lbcu  ft, or 7.75 and 8.05  gcm 3 4.48 and 4.65  ozcu  in. 6  Even in a narrow range of concentrations of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel, a number of different metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel. At room temperature , the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centered cubic BCC structure called alpha iron or -iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005 at 0  C 32  F and 0.021 wt at 723  C 1,333  F. The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite . At 910  C, pure iron transforms into a face-centered cubic FCC structure, called gamma iron or -iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1 7  38 times that of ferrite carbon at 1,148  C 2,098  F, which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron. 8  When carbon moves out of solution with iron, it forms a very hard, but brittle material called cementite Fe 3 C. When steels with exactly 0.8 carbon known as a eutectoid steel, are cooled, the austenitic phase FCC of the mixture attempts to revert to the ferrite phase BCC. The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite , leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with a small percentage of carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite , named for its resemblance to mother of pearl . In a hypereutectoid composition greater than 0.8 carbon, the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percentage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition 0.8 carbon, at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8 carbon hypoeutectoid, ferri te will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8 of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. 9  The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate. As the rate of cooling is increased the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooli ng rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face-centered austenite and forms martensite . Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2 carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal BCT structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite.  clarification needed  Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors. 10  Martensite has a lower density it expands during the cooling than does austenite, so that the transformation between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally take the form of compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible. 11  Heat treatment  edit  Main article Heat treating There are many types of heat treating processes available to steel. The most common are annealing , quenching, and tempering . Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the eutectoid composition hypereutectoid of 0.8 carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment. Annealing is the process of heating the steel to a sufficiently high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases recovery , recrystallization , and grain growth . The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents. 12  Quenching involves heating the steel to create the austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil . This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. 10  The steel is then tempered, which is just a specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing tempering process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel. 13  Steel production  edit  Main article Steelmaking See also List of countries by steel production Iron ore pellets for the production of steel When iron is smelted from its ore, it contains more carbon than is desirable. To become steel, it must be reprocessed to reduce the carbon to the correct amount, at which point other elements can be added. In the past, steel facilities would cast the raw steel product into ingots which would be stored until use in further refinement processes that resulted in the finished pro duct. In modern facilities, the initial product is close to the final composition and is continuously cast into long slabs, cut and shaped into bars and extrusions and heat treated to produce a final product. Today only a small fraction is cast into ingots . Approximately 96 of steel is continuously cast, while only 4 is produced as ingots. 14  The ingots are then heated in a soaking pit and hot rolled into slabs, billets , or blooms . Slabs are hot or cold rolled into sheet metal or plates. Billets are hot or cold rolled into bars, rods, and wire. Blooms are hot or cold rolled into structural steel , such as I-beams and rails . In modern steel mills these processes often occur in one assembly line , with ore coming in and finished steel products coming out. 15  Sometimes after a steels final rolling, it is heat treated for strength however, this is relatively rare. 16  History of steelmaking  edit  Main articles History of ferrous metallurgy and History of the steel industry 18501970 Bloomery smelting during the Middle Ages Ancient steel  edit  Steel was known in antiquity and was produced in bloomeries and crucibles. 17  18  The earliest known production of steel is seen in pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia  Kaman-Kalehyk  and are nearly 4,000 years old, dating from 1800 BC. 19  20  Horace identifies steel weapons such as the falcata in the Iberian Peninsula , while Noric steel was used by the Roman military . 21  The reputation of Seric iron of South India wootz steel grew considerably in the rest of the world. 18  Metal production sites in Sri Lanka employed wind furnaces driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. Large-scale Wootz steel production in Tamilakam using crucibles and carbon sources such as the plant Avram occurred by the sixth century BC, the pioneering precursor to modern steel production and metallurgy. 17  18  The Chinese of the Warring States period 403221 BC had quench-hardened steel, 22  while Chinese of the Han dynasty 202 BC  220 AD created steel by melting together wrought iron with cast iron, gaining an ultimate product of a carbon-intermediate steel by the 1st century AD. 23  24  Wootz steel and Damascus steel  edit  Main articles Wootz steel and Damascus steel Evidence of the earliest production of high carbon steel in India are found in Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu , the Golconda area in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka , and in the Samanalawewa areas of Sri Lanka . 25  This came to be known as Wootz steel , produced in South India by about sixth century BC and exported globally. 26  27  The steel technology existed prior to 326 BC in the region as they are mentioned in literature of Sangam Tamil , Arabic and Latin as the finest steel in the world exported to the Romans, Egyptian, Chinese and Arab worlds at that time  what they called Seric Iron . 28  A 200 BC Tamil trade guild in Tissamaharama , in the South East of Sri Lanka, brought with them some of the oldest iron and steel artifacts and production processes to the island from the classical period . 29  30  31  The Chinese and locals in Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka had also adopted the production methods of creating Wootz steel from the Chera Dynasty Tamils of South India by the 5th century AD. 32  33  In Sri Lanka, this early steel-making method employed a unique wind furnace, driven by the monsoon winds, capable of producing high-carbon steel. 34  35  Since the technology was acquired from the Tamilians from South India,  citation needed  the origin of steel technology in India can be conservatively estimated at 400500 BC. 26  35  The manufacture of what came to be called Wootz, or Damascus steel , famous for its durability and ability to hold an edge, may have been taken by the Arabs from Persia, who took it from India. It was originally created from a number of different materials including various trace elements , apparently ultimately from the writings of Zosimos of Panopolis . In 327 BC, Alexander the Great was rewarded by the defeated King Porus , not with gold or silver but with 30 pounds of steel. 36  Recent studies have suggested that carbon nanotubes were included in its structure, which might explain some of its legendary qualities, though given the technology of that time, such qualities were produced by chance rather than by design. 37  Natural wind was used where the soil containing iron was heated by the use of wood. The ancient Sinhalese managed to extract a ton of steel for every 2 tons of soil, 34  a remarkable feat at the time. One such furnace was found in Samanalawewa and archaeologists were able to produce steel as the ancients did. 34  38  Crucible steel , formed by slowly heating and cooling pure iron and carbon typically in the form of charcoal in a crucible, was produced in Merv by the 9th to 10th century AD. 27  In the 11th century, there is evidence of the production of steel in Song China using two techniques a berganesque method that produced inferior, inhomogeneous steel, and a precursor to the modern Bessemer process that used partial decarbonization via repeated forging under a cold blast . 39  Modern steelmaking  edit  A Bessemer converter in Sheffield , England Since the 17th century, the first step in European steel production has been the smelting of iron ore into pig iron in a blast furnace . 40  Originally employing charcoal, modern methods use coke , which has proven more economical. 41  42  43  Processes starting from bar iron  edit  Main articles Blister steel and Crucible steel In these processes pig iron was refined fined in a finery forge to produce bar iron , which was then used in steel-making. 40  The production of steel by the cementation process was described in a treatise published in Prague in 1574 and was in use in Nuremberg from 1601. A similar process for case hardening armor and files was described in a book published in Naples in 1589. The process was introduced to England in about 1614 and used to produce such steel by Sir Basil Brooke at Coalbrookdale during the 1610s. 44  The raw material for this process were bars of iron. During the 17th century it was realized that the best steel came from oregrounds iron of a region north of Stockholm , Sweden. This was still the usual raw material source in the 19th century, almost as long as the process was used. 45  46  Crucible steel is steel that has been melted in a crucible rather than having been forged , with the result that it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s. Blister steel made as above was melted in a crucible or in a furnace, and cast usually into ingots. 46  47  Processes starting from pig iron  edit  A Siemens-Martin steel oven from the Brandenburg Museum of Industry. White-hot steel pouring out of an electric arc furnace. The modern era in steelmaking began with the introduction of Henry Bessemer s Bessemer process in 1855, the raw material for which was pig iron. 48  His method let him produce steel in large quantities cheaply, thus mild steel came to be used for most purposes for which wrought iron was formerly used. 49  The Gilchrist-Thomas process or basic Bessemer process  was an improvement to the Bessemer process, made by lining the converter with a basic material to remove phosphorus. Another 19th-century steelmaking process was the Siemens-Martin process , which complemented the Bessemer process. 46  It consisted of co-melting bar iron or steel scrap with pig iron. These methods of steel production were rendered obsolete by the Linz-Donawitz process of basic oxygen steelmaking BOS, developed in 1952, 50  and other oxygen steel making methods. Basic oxygen steelmaking is superior to previous steelmaking methods because the oxygen pumped into the furnace limited impurities, primarily nitrogen, that previously had entered from the air used, 51  and because, with respect to the open hearth process, the same quantity of steel from a BOS process is manufactured in one-twelfth the time. 50  Today, electric arc furnaces EAF are a common method of reprocessing scrap metal to create new steel. They can also be used for converting pig iron to steel, but they use a lot of electrical energy about 440 kWh per metric ton, and are thus generally only economical when there is a plentiful supply of cheap electricity. 52  Steel industry  edit  See also History of the steel industry 18501970 , Global steel industry trends , Steel production by country , and List of steel producers Steel production in million tons by country in 2007 The steel industry is often considered an indicator of economic progress, because of the critical role played by steel in infrastructural and overall economic development . 53  In 1980, there were more than 500,000 U.S. steelworkers. By 2000, the number of steelworkers fell to 224,000. 54  The economic boom in China and India caused a massive increase in the demand for steel. Between 2000 and 2005, world steel demand increased by 6. Since 2000, several Indian 55  and Chinese steel firms have risen to prominence,  according to whom  such as Tata Steel which bought Corus Group in 2007, Baosteel Group and Shagang Group . As of 2017, though, ArcelorMittal is the worlds largest steel producer . 56  In 2005, the British Geological Survey stated China was the top steel producer with about one-third of the world share Japan, Russia, and the US followed respectively. 57  In 2008, steel began trading as a commodity on the London Metal Exchange . At the end of 2008, the steel industry faced a sharp downturn that led to many cut-backs. 58  Recycling  edit  Main article Ferrous metal recycling Steel is one of the worlds most-recycled materials, with a recycling rate of over 60 globally 59  in the United States alone, over 82,000,000 metric tons 81,000,000 long tons 90,000,000 short tons were recycled in the year 2008, for an overall recycling rate of 83. 60  As more steel is produced than is scrapped, the amount of recycled raw materials is about 40 of the total of steel produced - in 2016, 1,628,000,000 tonnes 1.602  10 9 long tons 1.795  10 9 short tons of crude steel was produced globally, with 630,000,000 tonnes 620,000,000 long tons 690,000,000 short tons recycled. 61  Contemporary steel  edit  Bethlehem Steel  Bethlehem, Pennsylvania facility pictured was one of the worlds largest manufacturers of steel before its closure in 2003 See also Steel grades Carbon steels  edit  Modern steels are made with varying combinations of alloy metals to fulfill many purposes. 5  Carbon steel , composed simply of iron and carbon, accounts for 90 of steel production. 3  Low alloy steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum , manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10 by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. 3  High strength low alloy steel has small additions usually  2 by weight of other elements, typically 1.5 manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase. 62  Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy CAFE regulations have given rise to a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel AHSS. This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel , which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. 63  Transformation Induced Plasticity TRIP steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. 64  Twinning Induced Plasticity TWIP steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy. 65  Carbon Steels are often galvanized , through hot-dip or electroplating in zinc for protection against rust. 66  Alloy steels  edit  Stainless steels contain a minimum of 11 chromium, often combined with nickel, to resist corrosion . Some stainless steels, such as the ferritic stainless steels are magnetic , while others, such as the austenitic , are nonmagnetic. 67  Corrosion-resistant steels are abbreviated as CRES. Some more modern steels include tool steels , which are alloyed with large amounts of tungsten and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening . This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloys temperature resistance. 3  Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include weathering steels such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. 68  Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon 0.01. This creates a very strong but still malleable steel. 69  Eglin steel uses a combination of over a dozen different elements in varying amounts to create a relatively low-cost steel for use in bunker buster weapons. Hadfield steel after Sir Robert Hadfield  or manganese steel contains 1214 manganese which when abraded strain-hardens to form an very hard skin which resists wearing. Examples include tank tracks , bulldozer blade edges and cutting blades on the jaws of life . 70  Standards  edit  Most of the more commonly used steel alloys are categorized into various grades by standards organizations. For example, the Society of Automotive Engineers has a series of grades defining many types of steel. 71  The American Society for Testing and Materials has a separate set of standards, which define alloys such as A36 steel , the most commonly used structural steel in the United States. 72  The JIS also define series of steel grades that are being used extensively in Japan as well as in developing countries. Uses  edit  A roll of steel wool Iron and steel are used widely in the construction of roads, railways, other infrastructure, appliances, and buildings. Most large modern structures, such as stadiums and skyscrapers, bridges, and airports, are supported by a steel skeleton. Even those with a concrete structure employ steel for reinforcing. In addition, it sees widespread use in major appliances and cars . Despite growth in usage of aluminium , it is still the main material for car bodies. Steel is used in a variety of other construction materials, such as bolts, nails , and screws and other household products and cooking utensils. 73  Other common applications include shipbuilding , pipelines , mining , offshore construction , aerospace , white goods e.g. washing machines , heavy equipment such as bulldozers, office furniture, steel wool , tools , and armour in the form of personal vests or vehicle armour better known as rolled homogeneous armour in this role. Historical  edit  A carbon steel knife Before the introduction of the Bessemer process and other modern production techniques, steel was expensive and was only used where no cheaper alternative existed, particularly for the cutting edge of knives , razors , swords , and other items where a hard, sharp edge was needed. It was also used for springs , including those used in clocks and watches . 46  With the advent of speedier and thriftier production methods, steel has become easier to obtain and much cheaper. It has replaced wrought iron for a multitude of purposes. However, the availability of plastics in the latter part of the 20th century allowed these materials to replace steel in some applications due to their lower fabrication cost and weight. 74  Carbon fiber is replacing steel in some cost insensitive applications such as sports equipment and high end automobiles.
