A design review is a milestone within a product development process whereby a design is evaluated against its requirements in order to verify the outcomes of previous activities and identify issues before committing to - and if need to be re-prioritise - further work. The ultimate design review, if successful, therefore triggers the product launch or product release. The conduct of design reviews is compulsory as part of design controls , when developing products in certain regulated contexts such as medical devices . By definition, a review must include persons who are external to the design team. Contents of a design review  edit  In order to evaluate a design against its requirements, a number of means may be considered, such as Physical tests. Engineering simulations. Examinations Walk-through. Timing of design reviews  edit  Most formalised systems engineering processes recognise that the cost of correcting a fault increases as it progresses through the development process . Additional effort spent in the early stages of development to discover and correct errors is therefore likely to be worthwhile. Design reviews are example of such an effort. Therefore, a number of design reviews may be carried out, for example to evaluate the design against different sets of criteria consistency, usability , ease of localisation , environmental or during various stages of the design process.
