Melamine foam From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Microporous polymer foam with multiple applications Melamine foam is a foam -like material consisting of a formaldehyde - melamine - sodium bisulfite copolymer . The foam is manufactured by several manufacturers worldwide, most notably by BASF of Germany under the name Basotect . It has been used for over twenty years  when  as insulation for pipes and ductwork , and has a long history as a soundproofing material for studios, sound stages , auditoriums, and the like. The low smoke and flame properties of melamine foam prevent it from being a fire hazard. 1   better  source  needed  Melamine foam is the active component of a number of abrasive cleaner sponges. It is also used as the main sound and thermal insulation material for bullet trains , due to its high sound absorption, excellent thermal insulation performance and light weight.

On a larger scale the material feels soft because the reticulated foam bubbles interconnect. Its structure is a 3D network of very hard strands, when compared to the array of separate bubbles in a material such as styrofoam . 3  Rubbing with a slightly moistened foam may remove otherwise uncleanable external markings from surfaces. For example, melamine foam can remove crayon , marker pen , and grease from painted walls and wood finishings, plastic-adhering paints from treated wooden tables, and adhesive residue and grime from hubcaps . 4  If the surface being cleaned is not sufficiently hard, it may be finely scratched by the melamine material. The foam wears away, rather like a pencil eraser , leaving behind a slight residue which can be rinsed off. The material is also sold as an effective dental stain remover for personal use. It is however warned to not use it on dental fillings as their surface may lose its shine.  citation needed  See also  edit  Melamine resin References  edit   Melamine Foam Featured Properties .
