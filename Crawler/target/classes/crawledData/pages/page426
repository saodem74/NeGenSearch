When asked in a 2006 interview with internetnews.com whether he considered patenting the wiki concept, he explained that he thought the idea just sounded like something that no one would want to pay money for. 12  Cunningham is interested in tracking the number and location of wiki page edits as a sociological experiment and may even consider the degradation of a wiki page as part of its process to stability. There are those who give and those who take.

Cunninghams Law  edit  Ward Cunningham, 2011 Ward is credited with the idea The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, its to post the wrong answer. 15  This refers to the observation that people are quicker to correct a wrong answer than to answer a question. According to Steven McGeady , Cunningham advised him in the early 1980s, The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, its to post the wrong answer. McGeady dubbed this Cunninghams law . 16  Although originally referring to interactions on Usenet , the law has been used to describe how other online communities work, such as Wikipedia. 17  Cunningham himself denies ownership of the law, calling it a misquote that disproves itself by propagating through the internet. 18  Personal life  edit  Cunningham lives in Beaverton, Oregon . 11  He holds an Amateur Radio Extra Class license issued by the Federal Communications Commission , and his call sign is Kilo Nine Oscar X-ray, K9OX. 19  20  21  22  Cunningham is Nike s first Code for a Better World Fellow. 23  Publications  edit  Leuf, Bo Cunningham, Ward 2001.
