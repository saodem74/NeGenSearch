It was established in 1948 for the purpose of assisting members of the National Diet of Japan   , Kokkai  in researching matters of public policy. The library is similar in purpose and scope to the United States Library of Congress . The National Diet Library NDL consists of two main facilities in Tky and Kyt , and several other branch libraries throughout Japan.

The Diets power in prewar Japan was limited, and its need for information was correspondingly small. The original Diet libraries never developed either the collections or the services which might have made them vital adjuncts of genuinely responsible legislative activity. Until Japans defeat, moreover, the executive had controlled all political documents, depriving the people and the Diet of access to vital information. The U.S. occupation forces under General Douglas MacArthur deemed reform of the Diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of Japan after its defeat in World War II . In 1946, each house of the Diet formed its own National Diet Library Standing Committee. Hani Gor , a Marxist historian who had been imprisoned during the war for thought crimes and had been elected to the House of Councillors the successor to the abolished House of Peers after the war, spearheaded the reform efforts. Hani envisioned the new body as both a citadel of popular sovereignty  , and the means of realizing a peaceful revolution. The Occupation officers responsible for overseeing library reforms reported that, although the Occupation was a catalyst for change, local initiative pre-existed the Occupation, and the successful reforms were due to dedicated Japanese like Hani. The National Diet Library opened in June 1948 in the present-day State Guest-House former Akasaka Detached Palace with an initial collection of 100,000 volumes. The first Librarian of the Diet Library was the politician Tokujir Kanamori . 3  The philosopher Masakazu Nakai served as the first Vice Librarian. 3  In 1949, the NDL merged with the National Library previously called the Imperial Library and became the only national library in Japan. At this time the collection gained an additional million volumes previously housed in the former National Library in Ueno . In 1961, the NDL opened at its present location 4  in Nagatach , adjacent to the National Diet. In 1986, the NDLs Annex was completed to accommodate a combined total of 12 million books and periodicals. The Kansai-kan the Kansai Library, which opened in October 2002 in the Kansai Science City  Seika Town, Sraku County , Kyoto Prefecture , has a collection of 6 million items. In May 2002, the NDL opened a new branch, the International Library of Childrens Literature , in the former building of the Imperial Library in Ueno. This branch contains some 400,000 items of childrens literature from around the world. Though the NDLs original mandate was to be a research library for the National Diet, the general public is the largest consumer of the librarys services. In the fiscal year ending March 2004, for example, the library reported more than 250,000 reference inquiries in contrast, it recorded only 32,000 requests for research from the National Diet. Main collection  edit  The National Diet Library Main building in Tokyo As Japans national library, the NDL collects copies of all publications published in Japan. Moreover, because the NDL serves as a research library for Diet members, their staffs, and the general public, it maintains an extensive collection of materials published in foreign languages on a wide range of topics. Important special collections  edit  The NDL also has eight major specialized collections Modern Political and Constitutional History Materials Concerning the Postwar Occupation of Japan Laws and Preliminary Records Science and Technology Maps Music Foreign Books About Japan and Rare Books. Modern political and constitutional history  edit  The Modern Political and Constitutional History Collection comprises some 300,000 items related to Japans political and legal modernization in the 19th century, including the original document archives of important Japanese statesmen from the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century like It Hirobumi , Iwakura Tomomi , Sanj Sanetomi , Mutsu Munemitsu , Terauchi Masatake , and other influential figures from the Meiji 18681912 and Taish 19121926 periods. Materials concerning the postwar occupation of Japan  edit  The NDL has an extensive microform collection of some 30 million pages of documents relating to the Occupation of Japan after World War II. This collection include the documents prepared by General Headquarters GHQ and the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers SCAP, the Far Eastern Commission FEC, and the United States Strategic Bombing Survey Team . The originals of these documents are in the possession of the United States National Archives . Laws and preliminary records  edit  The Laws and Preliminary Records Collection consists of some 170,000 Japanese and 200,000 foreign-language documents concerning proceedings of the National Diet and the legislatures of some 70 foreign countries, and the official gazettes, statutes, judicial opinions, and international treaties pertaining to some 150 foreign countries.

Music  edit  The NDL collects all phonographic recordings made in Japan, and presently holds a collection comprising 300,000 vinyl records and 200,000 compact disks. Foreign books about Japan  edit  Following the tradition established by the Imperial Library, the NDL collects foreign-language materials about Japan, including rare and ancient documents, such as reports of European missionaries visiting Japan in the 16th century. Rare books and old materials  edit  The Analects of Confucius in the collection of the National Diet Library has a back flyleaf with Nobukatas autograph provenance notes dated November of the 16th year of the Tenmon era 1547 and is clearly printed therefore this seems to be a rare first edition. A sumptuous cover made of Nishijin brocade was put on the book in the Edo period . The NDL houses the former Imperial Librarys collection of Japanese language materials from the Edo period 16031867 and earlier periods. The major catalogues in this collection include 1 some 6,000 documents relating to the Tokugawa shogunate 16031867, such as records of town magistrates, the shogunal Supreme Court, and the Jisha-bugy Commissioners of Shrines and Temples, as well as documents concerning the succession of shguns  2 the It Bunko and Shirai Bunko , consisting of 8,000 handwritten and woodblock printed books dating from the Edo and Meiji periods and concerning Japanese medicine and 3 the Shinjo Bunko , consisting of 11,000 examples of pre-modern writings on astronomy and calendars, in addition to ancient Chinese works on the Qing dynasty , genealogy, and local history.
