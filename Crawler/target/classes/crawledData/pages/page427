ACM is organized into over 171 local chapters and 37 Special Interest Groups SIGs, through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette . Many of the SIGs, such as SIGGRAPH , SIGPLAN , SIGCSE and SIGCOMM , sponsor regular conferences, which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters. ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest ICPC, and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue computer. Services  edit  Publications  edit  Main category Association for Computing Machinery publications ACM publishes over 50 journals 6  including the prestigious 7  Journal of the ACM , and two general magazines for computer professionals, Communications of the ACM also known as Communications or CACM  and Queue . Other publications of the ACM include ACM XRDS , formerly Crossroads, was redesigned in 2010 and is the most popular student computing magazine in the US. ACM Interactions , an interdisciplinary HCI publication focused on the connections between experiences, people and technology, and the third largest ACM publication. 8  ACM Computing Surveys CSUR Computers in Entertainment CIE ACM Special Interest Group Computers and Society SIGCAS 9  A number of journals, specific to subfields of computer science, titled ACM Transactions . Some of the more notable transactions include ACM Transactions on Computer Systems TOCS IEEEACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics TCBB ACM Transactions on Computational Logic TOCL ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction TOCHI ACM Transactions on Database Systems TODS ACM Transactions on Graphics TOG ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software TOMS ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications TOMM IEEEACM Transactions on Networking TON ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems TOPLAS Although Communications no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages. ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its Digital Library and also has a Guide to Computing Literature . Individual members additionally have access to Safari Books Online and Books24x7. ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members. In 1997, ACM Press published Wizards and Their Wonders Portraits in Computing  .mw-parser-output cite.citationfont-styleinherit.mw-parser-output .citation qquotes.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lock-green.svg9px-Lock-green.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation . cs1-lock-registration abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lock-gray-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLock-red-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-po sitionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registrationcolor555.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration spanborder-bottom1px dottedcursorhelp.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisource-logo.svg12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.pngno -repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output code.cs1-codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginherit.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-errordisplaynonefont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-errorfont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33margin-left0.3em.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-o utput .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-formatfont-size95.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-leftpadding-left0.2em.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-rightpadding-right0.2em ISBN   0897919602 , written by Christopher Morgan, with new photographs by Louis Fabian Bachrach . The book is a collection of historic and current portrait photographs of figures from the computer industry. Portal and Digital Library  edit  The ACM Portal is an online service of the ACM. 10  Its core are two main sections ACM Digital Library and the ACM Guide to Computing Literature . 11  The ACM Digital Library is the full-text collection of all articles published by the ACM in its articles, magazines and conference proceedings. The Guide is a bibliography in computing with over one million entries. 10  The ACM Digital Library contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organizations journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature. ACM adopted a hybrid Open Access OA publishing model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement. 12  ACM was a green publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Librarys permanently maintained Version of Record. All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including abstracts , linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription. There is also a mounting challenge to the ACMs publication practices coming from the open access movement. Some authors see a centralized peer review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arXiv . Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research JAIR , Journal of Machine Learning Research JMLR and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology. Membership grades  edit  Main category Members of the Association for Computing Machinery In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers. 13  The number of Fellows, Distinguished Members, and Senior Members cannot exceed 1, 10, and 25 of the total number of professional members, respectively. 14  Fellows  edit  Main article ACM Fellow For a more comprehensive list, see List of Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery . The ACM Fellows Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM. There are 1163 Fellows as of 2019 update  15  out of about 100,000 members. Distinguished Members  edit  In 2006, ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and have made a significant impact on the computing field. Note that in 200 6 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called Distinguished Member and was changed about two years later to Distinguished Educator. Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles. Senior Members  edit  Also in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. According to the ACM, The Senior Members Grade recognizes those ACM members with at least 10 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous Professional Membership who have demonstrated performance through technical leadership, and technical or professional contributions. 16  Senior membership also requires 3 letters of reference Distinguished Speakers  edit  While not technically a membership grade, the ACM recognizes distinguished speakers on topics in computer science. A distinguished speaker is appointed for a three-year period. There are usually about 125 current distinguished speakers. The ACM website describes these people as Renowned International Thought Leaders. 17  The distinguished speaker program is overseen by a committee 18  Chapters  edit  ACM has three kinds of chapters Special Interest Groups , 19  Professional Chapters, and Student Chapters. 20  As of 2011 update  , ACM has professional  SIG Chapters in 56 countries. 21  As of 2014 update  , there exist ACM student chapters in 41 different countries. 22  Special Interest Groups  edit  Main category Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Groups SIGACCESS  Accessible Computing SIGACT  Algorithms and Computation Theory SIGAda Ada Programming Language SIGAI  Artificial Intelligence SIGAPP Applied Computing SIGARCH  Computer Architecture SIGBED Embedded Systems SIGBio Bioinformatics SIGCAS Computers and Society SIGCHI  Computer Human Interaction SIGCOMM  Data Communication SIGCSE  Computer Science Education SIGDA  Design Automation SIGDOC  Design of Communication SIGecom Electronic Commerce SIGEVO Genetic and Evolutionary Computation SIGGRAPH  Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques SIGHPC  High Performance Computing SIGIR  Information Retrieval SIGITE Information Technology Education SIGKDD  Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining SIGLOG Logic and Computation 23  SIGMETRICS  Measurement and Evaluation SIGMICRO Microarchitecture SIGMIS Management Information Systems SIGMM  Multimedia SIGMOBILE  Mobility of Systems, Users, Data and Computing SIGMOD  Management of Data SIGOPS  Operating Systems SIGPLAN  Programming Languages SIGSAC Security, Audit, and Control SIGSAM  Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation SIGSIM Simulation and Modeling SIGSOFT  Software Engineering SIGSPATIAL Spatial Information SIGUCCS  University and College Computing Services SIGWEB  Hypertext, Hypermedia, and Web Conferences  edit  Main category Association for Computing Machinery conferences ACM and its Special Interest Groups SIGs sponsors numerous conferences with 170 hosted worldwide in 2017. ACM Conferences page has an up-to-date complete list while a partial list is shown below. Most of the SIGs also have an annual conference. ACM conferences are often very popular publishing venues and are therefore very competitive. For example, the 2007 SIGGRAPH conference attracted about 30000 visitors, and CIKM only accepted 15 of the long papers that were submitted in 2005.

This institution is often referred to simply as Council in Communications of the ACM . Infrastructure  edit  ACM has five Boards that make up various committees and subgroups, to help Headquarters staff maintain quality services and products. These boards are as follows Publications Board SIG Governing Board Education Board Membership Services Board Practitioners Board ACM Council on Women in Computing  edit  ACM-W , 39  the ACM council on women in computing , supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in computing. ACMWs main programs are regional celebrations of women in computing, ACM-W chapters, and scholarships for women CS students to attend research conferences. In India and Europe these activities are overseen by ACM-W India and ACM-W Europe respectively. ACM-W collaborates with organizations such as the Anita Borg Institute , the National Center for Women  Information Technology NCWIT , and Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research CRA-W . Athena Lectures  edit  The ACM-W gives an annual Athena Lecturer Award to honor outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science. 40  This program began in 2006. Speakers are nominated by SIG officers. 41  20062007 Deborah Estrin of UCLA 20072008 Karen Sprck Jones of Cambridge University 20082009 Shafi Goldwasser of MIT and the Weitzmann Institute of Science 20092010 Susan J.

The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science , but there is considerable overlap with ACMs agenda. They have many joint activities including conferences, publications and awards. 43  ACM and its SIGs co-sponsor about 20 conferences each year with IEEE-CS and other parts of IEEE. 44  Eckert-Mauchly Award and Ken Kennedy Award , both major awards in computer science, are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE-CS. 45  They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula. 46  ACM has also jointly sponsored on events with other professional organizations like the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics SIAM. 47  See also  edit  Computer Science portal ACM Classification Scheme Computer science Computing Fellows of the ACM by year Fellows of the ACM category Grace Murray Hopper Award Presidents of the Association for Computing Machinery Timeline of computing 2400 BC1949 Turing Award Franz Alt , former president Edmund Berkeley , co founder Bernard Galler , former president References  edit   Indiana University Media Relations . indiana.edu .
