The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the only partially compatible Model 44 and the most expensive systems use microcode to implement the instruction set, which features 8-bit byte addressing and binary, decimal and hexadecimal floating-point calculations. The launch of the System360 family introduced IBMs Solid Logic Technology SLT , a new technology that was the start of more powerful but smaller computers. 2  The slowest System360 model announced in 1964, the Model 30 , could perform up to 34,500 instructions per second, with memory from 8 to 64   KB . 3  High performance models came later. The 1967 IBM System360 Model 91 could do up to 16.6 million instructions per second . 4  The larger 360 models could have up to 8   MB of main memory , 5  though main memory that big was unusuala large installation might have as little as 256  KB of main storage, but 512  KB, 768  KB or 1024  KB was more common. Up to 8 megabytes of slower 8 microsecond Large Capacity Storage LCS was also available. The IBM 360 was extremely successful in the market, allowing customers to purchase a smaller system with the knowledge they would always be able to migrate upward if their needs grew, without reprogramming of application software or replacing peripheral devices. Many consider the design one of the most successful computers in history, influencing computer design for years to co me. The chief architect of System360 was Gene Amdahl , and the project was managed by Fred Brooks , responsible to Chairman Thomas J. Watson Jr. 5  The commercial release was piloted by another of Watsons lieutenants, John R. Opel , who managed the launch of IBMs System 360 mainframe family in 1964. 6  Application-level compatibility with some restrictions for System360 software is maintained to the present day with the System z mainframe servers.

This feat allowed customers to use a cheaper model and then upgrade to larger systems as their needs increased without the time and expense of rewriting software. Before the introduction of System360, business and scientific applications used different computers with different instruction sets and operating systems. Different-sized computers also had their own instruction sets. IBM was the first manufacturer to exploit microcode technology to implement a compatible range of computers of widely differing performance, although the largest, fastest, models had hard-wired logic instead. This flexibility greatly lowered barriers to entry. With most other vendors customers had to choose between machines they could outgrow and machines that were potentially too powerful and thus too costly. This meant that many companies simply did not buy computers. Models  edit  IBM initially announced a series of six computers and forty common peripherals. IBM eventually delivered fourteen models, including rare one-off models for NASA . The least expensive model was the Model 20 with as little as 4096 bytes of core memory , eight 16-bit registers instead of the sixteen 32-bit registers of other System360 models, and an instruction set that was a subset of that used by the rest of the range. The initial announcement in 1964 included Models 30 , 40 , 50 , 60, 62, and 70. The first three were low- to middle-range systems aimed at the IBM 1400 series market. All three first shipped in mid-1965. The last three, intended to replace the 7000 series machines, never shipped and were replaced with the 65 and 75 , which were first delivered in November 1965, and January 1966, respectively. Later additions to the low-end included models 20 1966, mentioned above, 22 1971, and 25 1968. The Model 20 had several sub-models sub-model 5 was at the higher end of the model. The Model 22 was a recycled Model 30 with minor limitations a smaller maximum memory configuration, and slower IO channels, which limited it to slower and lower-capacity disk and tape devices than on the 30. The Model 44 1966 was a specialized model, designed for scientific computing and for real-time computing and process control, featuring some additional instructions, and with all storage-to-storage instructions and five other complex instructions eliminated. This image of the IBM System 360 Model 91 operators console , was taken by NASA sometime in the late 1960s. A succession of high-end machines included the Model 67 1966, mentioned below, briefly anticipated as the 64 and 66 7  , 85 1969, 91 1967, anticipated as the 92, 95 1968, and 195 1971. The 85 design was intermediate between the System360 line and the follow-on System370 and was the basis for the 370165. There was a System370 version of the 195, but it did not include Dynamic Address Translation. The implementations differed substantially, using different native data path widths, presence or absence of microcode, yet were extremely compatible. Except where specifically documented, the models were architecturally compatible. The 91 , for example, was designed for scientific computing and provided out-of-order instruction execution and could yield imprecise interrupts if a program trap occurred while several instructions were being read, but lacked the decimal instruction set used in commercial applications. New features could be added without violating architectural definitions the 65 had a dual-processor version M65MP with extensions for inter-CPU signalling the 85 introduced cache memory. Models 44, 75, 91, 95, and 195 were implemented with hardwired logic, rather than microcoded as all other models. The Model 67 , announced in August 1965, was the first production IBM system to offer dynamic address translation virtual memory hardware to support time-sharing . DAT is now more commonly referred to as an MMU . An experimental one-off unit was built based on a model 40. Before the 67, IBM had announced models 64 and 66, DAT versions of the 60 and 62, but they were almost immediately replaced with the 67 at the same time that the 60 and 62 were replaced with the 65. DAT hardware would reappear in the S370 series in 1972, though it was initially absent from the series. Like its close relative, the 65, the 67 also offered dual CPUs. IBM stopped marketing all System360 models by the end of 1977. 8  Backward compatibility  edit  IBMs existing customers had a large investment in software that executed on second-generation machines . Several models offered the option of emulation of the customers previous computer using a combination of special hardware, 9  special microcode and an emulation program that used the emulation instructions to simulate the target system, so that old programs could run on the new machine. System360 model Emulated systems Model 20 1401 Model 30 1401 1440 1460 Model 40 1401 1440 1460 1410 7010 Model 50 1401 1440 1460 1410 7010 7070, 7072 and 7074 Model 65 7070, 7072 and 7074 7080 709 7090, 7094 7094 II 7040 and 7044 Model 85 709 7090, 7094 7094 II 7040 and 7044 Under OS control However, customers initially had to halt the computer and load the emulation program. 10  IBM later added features and modified emulator programs to allow emulation of the 1401, 1440, 1460, 1410 and 7010 under the control of an operating system. The Model 85 and later System370 maintained the precedent, retaining emulation options and allowing emulator programs to execute under operating system control alongside native programs. 11  Successors and variants  edit  System360 excepting the Model 20 was replaced with the compatible System370 range in 1970 and Model 20 users were targeted to move to the IBM System3 . The idea of a major breakthrough with FS technology was dropped in the mid-1970s for cost-effectiveness and continuity reasons. Later compatible IBM systems include the 4300 family , the 308x family , the 3090 , the ES9000 and 9672 families  System390 family, and the IBM Z series. Computers that were mostly identical or compatible in terms of the machine code or architecture of the System360 included Amdahl s 470 family and its successors, Hitachi mainframes, the UNIVAC 9000 series , 12  Fujitsu as the Facom, the RCA Spectra 70 series, NB 1  and the English Electric System 4 . NB 2  The System 4 machines were built under license to RCA. RCA sold the Spectra series to what was then UNIVAC , where they became the UNIVAC Series 70. UNIVAC also developed the UNIVAC Series 90 as successors to the 9000 series and Series 70. 12  The Soviet Union produced a System360 clone named the ES EVM . 13  The IBM 5100 portable computer, introduced in 1975, offered an option to execute the System360s APL.SV programming language through a hardware emulator. IBM used this approach to avoid the costs and delay of creating a 5100-specific version of APL. Special radiation-hardened and otherwise somewhat modified System360s, in the form of the System4 Pi avionics computer, are used in several fighter and bomber jet aircraft. In the complete 32-bit AP-101 version, 4 Pi machines were used as the replicated computing nodes of the fault-tolerant Space Shuttle computer system in five nodes. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration operated the IBM 9020 , a special cluster of modified System360s for air traffic control, from 1970 until the 1990s. Some 9020 software is apparently still used via emulation on newer hardware.  citation needed   Table of System360 models  edit  Model Announced 14  Shipped 14  Scientific performance kIPS NB 3  Commercial performance kIPS NB 4  CPU Bandwidth MBsec 15  Memory bandwidth MBsec 15  Memory size in  binary  KB Weight lbs Notes 30 Apr 1964 Jun 1965 10.2 29 1.3 0.7 8-64 16  1700 770  kg 17   2030.1 40 Apr 1964 Apr 1965 40 75 3.2 0.8 16-256 18  1700-2310 770-1050  kg depends on memory. 17   2040.1 50 Apr 1964 Aug 1965 133 169 8.0 2.0 64-512 19  4,700-7,135 2,100-3,236  kg depends on memory. 17   2050.2,2050.4 Supported IBM 2361 Large Capacity Storage LCS. 60 - 62 Apr 1964 never Replaced by Model 65 70 Apr 1964 never Replaced by Model 75 90 Apr 1964 never Replaced by Model 92 92 Aug 1964 never Redesignated as IBM System360 Model 91 14  20 Nov 1964 Mar 1966 2.0 2.6 4-32 20  1,2001,400 540640  kg 21  16-bit, low end, limited partially incompatible instruction set 91 Jan 1966 14   p.394 Oct 1967 1,900 1,800 133 164 1,024-4,096 22  Available on special bid beginning Nov 1964 14   388 64 - 66 Apr 1965 never Replaced by Model 67 65 Apr 1965 Nov 1965 563 567 40 21 128-1,024 23  4290-8830 1950-4005  kg depends on memory and number of processors. 17   2065.2,2065.4,2065.6,2065.8,2065.10 Supported LCS 75 Apr 1965 Jan 1966 940 670 41 43 256-1,024 24  5125-5325 2325-2415  kg depends on memory. 17   2075.2,2075.4 Supported LCS 67 Aug 1965 May 1966 40 21 512-2,048 25  3674 1700  kg - Processor only. 17   2067.6 Dynamic address translation for time sharing 44 Aug 1965 Sep 1966 118 185 16 4.0 32-256 26  2900-4200 1300-1900  kg depends on memory. 17   2044.2 Specialized for scientific computing 95 special order Feb 1968 3,800 est. 3,600 est. 133 711 5,220 27  Performance estimated as 2 Model 91 14   p.394 25 Jan 1968 Oct 1968 9.7 25 1.1 2.2 16-48 28  2050 930  kg 17   2025.2 85 Jan 1968 Dec 1969 3,245 3,418 100 67 512-4,096 29  14428 6544  kg - Processor only. 17   2085.2 16-32 KB cache memory, extended-precision floating point. 195 Aug 1969 Mar 1971 10,000 est. 10,000 est. 148 169 1,024-4,096 30  13450-28350 6150-12900  kg depends on memory. 17   3195.2,3195.4 32 KB IC cache memory.

Technical description  edit  Influential features  edit  IBM System360 Model 40 microcode transformer read-only storage TROS The System360 introduced a number of industry standards to the marketplace, such as The 8-bit byte against financial pressure during development to reduce the byte to 4 or 6 bits, rather than adopting the 7030 concept of accessing bytes of variable size at arbitrary bit addresses. Byte- addressable memory as opposed to bit-addressable or word-addressable memory 32-bit words The Bus and Tag IO channel standardized in FIPS-60 32  Commercial use of microcoded CPUs The IBM Floating Point Architecture The EBCDIC character set NB 5  Nine track magnetic tape Architectural overview  edit  Main article IBM System360 architecture The System360 series has a computer system architecture specification. 33  34  35  This specification makes no assumptions on the implementation itself, but rather describes the interfaces and expected behavior of an implementation. The architecture describes mandatory interfaces that must be available on all implementations, and optional interfaces. Some aspects of this architecture are Big endian byte ordering A processor with 16 32-bit general purpose registers R0-R15 A 64-bit program status word PSW, which describes among other things Interrupt masks Privilege states A condition code A 24-bit instruction address An interruption mechanism, maskable and unmaskable interruption classes and subclasses An instruction set . Each instruction is wholly described and also defines the conditions under which an exception is recognized in the form of program interruption. A memory called storage subsystem with 8 bits per byte A special processor communication area starting at address 0 24-bit addressing Manual control operations that allow A bootstrap process a process called Initial Program Load or IPL Operator-initiated interrupts Resetting the system Basic debugging facilities Manual display and modifications of the systems state memory and processor An InputOutput mechanism - which does not describe the devices themselves Some of the optional features are Binary-coded decimal instructions Floating point instructions Timing facilities interval timer Key-controlled memory protection All models of System360, except for the Model 20 and Model 44, implemented that specification. Binary arithmetic and logical operations are performed as register-to-register and as memory-to-registerregister-to-memory as a standard feature. If the Commercial Instruction Set option was installed, packed decimal arithmetic could be performed as memory-to-memory with some memory-to-register operations. The Scientific Instruction Set feature, if installed, provided access to four floating point registers that could be programmed for either 32-bit or 64-bit floating point operations. The Models 85 and 195 could also operate on 128-bit extended-precision floating point numbers stored in pairs of floating point registers, and software provided emulation in other models. The System360 used an 8-bit byte, 32-bit word, 64-bit double-word, and 4-bit nibble . Machine instructions had operators with operands, which could contain register numbers or memory addresses. This complex combination of instruction options resulted in a variety of instruction lengths and formats. Memory addressing was accomplished using a base-plus-displacement scheme, with registers 1 through F 15. A displacement was encoded in 12 bits, thus allowing a 4096-byte displacement 0-4095, as the offset from the address put in a base register. Register 0 could not be used as a base register nor as an index register nor as a branch address register, as 0 was reserved to indicate an address in the first 4  KB of memory, that is, if register 0 was specified as described, the value 0x00000000 was implicitly input to the effective address calculation in place of whatever value might be contained within register 0 or if specified as a branch address register, then no branch was taken, and the content of register 0 was ignored, but any side effect of the instruction was performed. This specific behavior permitted initial execution of an interrupt routines, since base registers would not necessarily be set to 0 during the first few instruction cycles of an interrupt routine. It isnt needed for IPL Initial Program Load or boot, as one can always clear a register without the need to save it. With the exception of the Model 67, 25  all addresses were real memory addresses. Virtual memory was not available in most IBM mainframes until the System370 series. The Model 67 introduced a virtual memory architecture, which MTS , CP-67 , and TSS360 usedbut not IBMs mainline System360 operating systems. The System360 machine-code instructions are 2 bytes long no memory operands, 4 bytes long one operand, or 6 bytes long two operands. Instructions are always situated on 2-byte boundaries. Operations like MVC Move-Characters Hex D2 can only move at most 256 bytes of information. Moving more than 256 bytes of data required multiple MVC operations. The System370 series introduced a family of more powerful instructions such as the MVCL Move-Characters-Long instruction, which supports moving up to 16  MB as a single block. An operand is two bytes long, typically representing an address as a 4-bit nibble denoting a base register and a 12-bit displacement relative to the contents of that register, in the range 000FFF shown here as hexadecimal numbers. The address corresponding to that operand is the contents of the specified general-purpose register plus the displacement. For example, an MVC instruction that moves 256 bytes with length code 255 in hexadecimal as FF  from base register 7, plus displacement 000 , to base register 8, plus displacement 001 , would be coded as the 6-byte instruction  D2FF 8001 7000  operatorlengthaddress1address2. The System360 was designed to separate the system state from the problem state . This provided a basic level of security and recoverability from programming errors. Problem user programs could not modify data or program storage associated with the system state. Addressing, data, or operation exception errors made the machine enter the system state through a controlled routine so the operating system could try to correct or terminate the program in error. Similarly, it could recover certain processor hardware errors through the machine check routines. Channels  edit  See also Channel IO Peripherals interfaced to the system via channels . A channel is a specialized processor with the instruction set optimized for transferring data between a peripheral and main memory. In modern terms, this could be compared to direct memory access DMA. Byte-multiplexor and selector channels  edit  There were initially two types of channels byte-multiplexer channels known at the time simply as multiplexor channels, for connecting slow speed devices such as card readers and punches, line printers , and communications controllers, and selector channels for connecting high speed devices, such as disk drives , tape drives , data cells and drums . Every System360 except for the Model 20, which was not a standard 360 has a byte-multiplexer channel and 1 or more selector channels. The smaller models up to the model 50 have integrated channels, while for the larger models model 65 and above the channels are large separate units in separate cabinets, such as the IBM 2860 and 2870. The 60, 62, and 70 allowed only for 2860 selector channels, on the assumption that they would all have smaller 360s attached, which would do the slow-speed work. The byte-multiplexer channel is able to handle IO tofrom several devices simultaneously at the devices highest rated speeds, hence the name, as it multiplexed IO from those devices onto a single data path to main memory. Devices connected to a byte-multiplexer channel are configured to operate in 1-byte, 2-byte, 4-byte, or burst mode. The larger blocks of data are used to handle progressively faster devices. For example, a 2501 card reader operating at 600 cards per minute would be in 1-byte mode, while a 1403-N1 printer would be in burst mode. Also, the byte-multiplexer channels on larger models have an optional selector subchannel section that would accommodate tape drives. The byte-multiplexors channel address was typically 0 and the selector subchannel addresses were from C0 to FF. Thus, tape drives on System360 were commonly addressed at 0C0-0C7. Other common byte-multiplexer addresses are 00A 2501 Card R eader, 00C00D 2540 ReaderPunch, 00E00F 1403-N1 Printers, 010-013 3211 Printers, 020-0BF 27012703 Telecommunications Units. These addresses are still commonly used in zVM virtual machines. System360 models 40 and 50 have an integrated 1052-7 console that is usually addressed as 01F, however, this was not connected to the byte-multiplexer channel, but rather, had a direct internal connection to the mainframe. The model 30 attached a different model of 1052 through a 1051 control unit. The models 60 through 75 also use the 1052-7. Cable used as Bus or Tag cable for IBM System360 Bus and tag terminators Selector channels enabled IO to high speed devices. These storage devices were attached to a control unit and then to the channel. The control unit let clusters of devices be attached to the channels. On higher speed models, multiple selector channels, which could operate simultaneously or in parallel, improved overall performance. Control units are connected to the channels with bus and tag cable pairs. The bus cables carried the address and data information and the tag cables identified what data was on the bus. The general configuration of a channel is to connect the devices in a chain, like this MainframeControl Unit XControl Unit YControl Unit Z. Each control unit is assigned a capture range of addresses that it services. For example, control unit X might capture addresses 40-4F, control unit Y C0-DF, and control unit Z 80-9F. Capture ranges had to be a multiple of 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 devices and be aligned on appropriate boundaries. Each control unit in turn has one or more devices attached to it. For example, you could have control unit Y with 6 disks, that would be addressed as C0-C5. There are three general types of bus-and-tag cables produced by IBM. The first is the standard gray bus-and-tag cable, followed by the blue bus-and-tag cable, and finally the tan bus-and-tag cable. Generally, newer cable revisions are capable of higher speeds or longer distances, and some peripherals specified minimum cable revisions both upstream and downstream. The cable ordering of the control units on the channel is also significant. Each control unit is strapped as High or Low priority. When a device selection was sent out on a mainframes channel, the selection was sent from X- Y- Z- Y- X. If the control unit was high then the selection was checked in the outbound direction, if low then the inbound direction. Thus, control unit X was either 1st or 5th, Y was either 2nd or 4th, and Z was 3rd in line. It is also possible to have multiple channels attached to a control unit from the same or multiple mainframes, thus providing a rich high-performance, multiple-access, and backup capability. Typically the total cable length of a channel is limited to 200 feet, less being preferred. Each control unit accounts for about 10 feet of the 200-foot limit. Block multiplexer channel  edit  IBM introduced a new type of IO channel on the Model 85 and Model 195 the 2880 block multiplexer channel. The channel allowed a device to suspend a channel program, pending the completion of an IO operation and thus to free the channel for use by another device. These channels can support either standard 1.5  MBsecond connections or, with the 2-byte interface feature, 3  MBsecond the latter use one tag cable and two bus cables. The initial use for this was the 2305 fixed-head disk, which has 8 exposures alias addresses and rotational position sensing RPS. They were standard on the System370 and thereafter. Block multiplexer channels can operate as a selector channel to allow compatible attachment of legacy subsystems. 36  Basic hardware components  edit  A single-width SLT card Many SLT cards plugged into an SLT frame. Being uncertain of the reliability and availability of the then new monolithic integrated circuits , IBM chose instead to design and manufacture its own custom hybrid integrated circuits . These were built on 11  mm square ceramic substrates. Resistors were silk screened on and discrete glass encapsulated transistors and diodes were added. The substrate was then covered with a metal lid or encapsulated in plastic to create a  Solid Logic Technology  SLT module. A number of these SLT modules were then flip chip mounted onto a small multi-layer printed circuit SLT card. Each card had one or two sockets on one edge that plugged onto pins on one of the computers SLT boards. This was the reverse of how most other companys cards were mounted, where the cards had pins or printed contact areas and plugged into sockets on the computers boards. Up to twenty SLT boards could be assembled side-by-side vertically and horizontally to form a logic gate. Several gates mounted together constituted a box-shaped logic frame. The outer gates were generally hinged along one vertical edge so they could be swung open to provide access to the fixed inner gates. The larger machines could have more than one frame bolted together to produce the final unit, such as a multi-frame Central Processing Unit CPU. Operating system software  edit  Main article System360 operating systems The smaller System360 models used the Basic Operating System360 BOS360 , Tape Operating System TOS360, or Disk Operating System360 DOS360, which evolved into DOSVS, DOSVSE, VSEAF, VSESP, VSEESA, and then zVSE . The larger models used Operating System360 OS360. IBM developed several versions of OS360, with increasingly powerful features Primary Control Program PCP, Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks MFT, and Multiprogramming with a Variable number of Tasks MVT. MVT took a long time to develop into a usable system, and the less ambitious MFT was widely used. PCP was used on intermediate machines the final releases of OS360 included only MFT and MVT. For the System370 and later machines, MFT evolved into OSVS1 , while MVT evolved into OSVS2 SVS Single Virtual Storage, then various versions of MVS Multiple Virtual Storage culminating in the current zOS . When it announced the Model 67 in August 1965, IBM also announced TSS360 Time-Sharing System for delivery at the same time as the 67. TSS360, a response to Multics , was an ambitious project that included many advanced features. It had performance problems, was delayed, canceled, reinstated, and finally canceled NB 6  again in 1971. Customers migrated to CP-67 , MTS  Michigan Terminal System , TSO  Time Sharing Option for OS360, or one of several other time-sharing systems. CP-67, the original virtual machine system, was also known as CPCMS . CP67 was developed outside the IBM mainstream at IBMs Cambridge Scientific Center , in cooperation with MIT researchers. CPCMS eventually won wide acceptance, and led to the development of VM370 Virtual Machine which had a primary interactive sub operating system known as VMCMS Conversational Monitoring System. This evolved into todays zVM . The Model 20 offered a simplified and rarely used tape-based system called TPS Tape Processing System, and DPS Disk Processing System that provided support for the 2311 disk drive. TPS could run on a machine with 8  KB of memory DPS required 12  KB, which was pretty hefty for a Model 20. Many customers ran quite happily with 4  KB and CPS Card Processing System. With TPS and DPS, the card reader was used to read the Job Control Language cards that defined the stack of jobs to run and to read in transaction data such as customer payments. The operating system was held on tape or disk, and results could also be stored on the tapes or hard drives. Stacked job processing became an exciting possibility for the small but adventurous computer user. A little-known and little-used suite of 80-column punched-card utility programs known as Basic Programming Support BPS jocularly Barely Programming Support, a precursor of TOS, was available for smaller systems. Component names  edit  IBM created a new naming system for the new components created for System360, although well-known old names, like IBM 1403 and IBM 1052 , were retained. In this new naming system, components were given four-digit numbers starting with 2. The second digit described the type of component, as follows 20xx Arithmetic processors, for example the IBM 2030 , which was the CPU for the IBM System360 Model 30 . 21xx Power supplies and other equipment intimately associated with processors, for example the IBM 2167 Configuration Unit . 22xx Visual output devices, for example the IBM 2250 and IBM 2260 CRT displays, and the IBM 2203 line printer for the System360 model 20. 23xx Direct-access storage devices, for example the IBM 2311 and IBM 2314 disk drives, the IBM 2321 Data Cell  Main storage such as the IBM 2361 Large Capacity Storage Core Storage, Large Core Storage or LCS and the IBM 2365 Processor Storage . 24xx Magnetic tape drives , for example the IBM 2401 , IBM 2405 and IBM 2415 . 25xx Punched card handling equipment, for example the IBM 2501  card reader , IBM 2520 card punch IBM 2540 readerpunch and IBM 2560 Multi-Function Card Machine or MFCM. 26xx Paper tape handling equipment, for example the IBM 2671 paper tape reader. 27xx Communications equipment, for example the IBM 2701 , IBM 2705 , IBM 2741 interactive terminal and the IBM 2780 batch terminal. 28xx Channels and controllers, for example the IBM 2821 Control Unit , IBM 2841 and IBM 2844 . 29xx Miscellaneous devices, for example the IBM 2914 Data Channel Switch and the IBM 2944 Data Channel Repeater . Peripherals  edit  IBM developed a new family of peripheral equipment for System360, carrying over a few from its older 1400 series. Interfaces were standardized, allowing greater flexibility to mix and match processors, controllers and peripherals than in the earlier product lines. In addition, System360 computers could use certain peripherals that were originally developed for earlier computers. These earlier peripherals used a different numbering system, such as the IBM 1403 chain printer. The 1403, an extremely reliable device that had already earned a reputation as a workhorse, was sold as the 1403-N1 when adapted for the System360. Also available were optical character recognition OCR readers IBM 1287 and IBM 1288 which could read Alpha Numeric AN and Numeric Hand Printed NHPNHW Characters from Cashiers rolls of tape to full legal size pages. At the time this was done with very large opticallogic readers. Software was too slow and expensive at that time. Most small systems were sold with an IBM 1052-7 as the console typewriter. This was tightly integrated into the CPU  the keyboard would physically lock under program control. Certain high-end machines could optionally be purchased with a 2250 graphical display, costing upwards of US 100,000. The 36085 used a 5450 display console that was not compatible with anything else in the line the later 3066 console for the 370165 and 370168 used the same basic display design as the 36085. Direct access storage devices DASD  edit  IBM 2311 disk drive See also IBM S360 and other IBM mainframe HDDs The first disk drives for System360 were IBM 2302s 37   6065 and IBM 2311s . 37   5458 The 156  KBsecond 2302 was based on the earlier 1302 and was available as a model 3 with two 112.79  MB modules 37   60 or as a model 4 with four such modules. 37   60 The 2311, with a removable 1316 disk pack , was based on the IBM 1311 and had a theoretical capacity of 7.2  MB, although actual capacity varied with record design. 38   31 When used with a 36020, the 1316 pack was formatted into fixed-length 270 byte sectors , giving a maximum capacity of 5.4MB. In 1966, the first 2314s shipped. This device had up to eight usable disk drives with an integral control unit there were nine drives, but one was reserved as a spare. Each drive used a removable 2316 disk pack with a capacity of nearly 28  MB. The disk packs for the 2311 and 2314 were physically large by todays standards  e.g., the 1316 disk pack was about 14  in 36  cm in diameter and had six platters stacked on a central spindle. The top and bottom outside platters did not store data. Data were recorded on the inner sides of the top and bottom platters and both sides of the inner platters, providing 10 recording surfaces. The 10 readwrite heads moved together across the surfaces of the platters, which were formatted with 203 concentric tracks. To reduce the amount of head movement seeking, data was written in a virtual cylinder from inside top platter down to inside bottom platter. These disks were not usually formatted with fixed-sized sectors as are todays hard drives though this was done with CPCMS . Rather, most System360 IO software could customize the length of the data record variable-length records, as was the case with magnetic tapes. IBM 2314 disk drives and IBM 2540 card readerpunch at the University of Michigan Some of the most powerful early System360s used high-speed head-per-track drum storage devices. The 3,500  RPM 2301, 39  which replaced the 7320, was part of the original System360 announcement, with a capacity of 4  MB. The 303.8  KBsecond IBM 2303 37   7476 was announced on January 31, 1966, with a capacity of 3.913  MB. These were the only drums announced for System360 and System370, and their niche was later filled by fixed-head disks. The 6,000  RPM 2305 appeared in 1970, with capacities of 5  MB 2305-1 or 11  MB 2305-2 per module. 40  41  Although these devices did not have large capacity, their speed and transfer rates made them attractive for high-performance needs. A typical use was overlay linkage e.g. for OS and application subroutines for program sections written to alternate in the same memory regions. Fixed head disks and drums were particularly effective as paging devices on the early virtual memory systems. The 2305, although often called a drum was actually a head-per-track disk device, with 12 recording surfaces and a data transfer rate up to 3  MB per second. Rarely seen was the IBM 2321 Data Cell , 42  a mechanically complex device that contained multiple magnetic strips to hold data strips could be randomly accessed, placed upon a cylinder-shaped drum for readwrite operations then returned to an internal storage cartridge. The IBM Data Cell noodle picker was among several IBM trademarked speedy mass online direct-access storage peripherals reincarnated in recent years as virtual tape and automated tape librarian peripherals. The 2321 file had a capacity of 400  MB, at the time when the 2311 disk drive only had 7.2  MB. The IBM Data Cell was proposed to fill costcapacityspeed gap between magnetic tapeswhich had high capacity with relatively low cost per stored byteand disks, which had higher expense per byte. Some installations also found the electromechanical operation less dependable and opted for less mechanical forms of direct-access storage. The Model 44 was unique in offering an integrated single-disk drive as a standard feature. This drive used the 2315 ramkit cartridge and provided 1,171,200 bytes of storage. 26   11 Tape drives  edit  IBM 2401 tape drives The 2400 tape drives consisted of a combined drive and control unit, plus individual 12 tape drives attached. With System360, IBM switched from IBM 7 track to 9 track tape format. 2400 drives could be purchased that read and wrote 7-track tapes for compatibility with the older IBM 729 tape drives. In 1967, a slower and cheaper pair of tape drives with integrated control unit was introduced the 2415. In 1968, the IBM 2420 tape system was released, offering much higher data rates, self-threading tape operation and 1600bpi packing density. It remained in the product line until 1979. Unit record devices  edit  IBM 1403 line printer Punched card devices included the 2501 card reader and the 2540 card reader punch. Virtually every System360 had a 2540. The 2560 MFCM Multi-Function Card Machine readersorterpunch, listed above, was for the Model 20 only. It was notorious for reliability problems earning humorous acronyms often involving ...Card Muncher or Mal-Function Card Machine. Line printers were the IBM 1403 and the slower IBM 1443 . A paper tape reader, the IBM 2671, was introduced in 1964. It had a rated speed of 1,000 cps. There were also a paper tape reader and paper tape punch from an earlier era, available only as RPQs  Request Price Quotation . The 1054 reader and 1055 punch, which were carried forward like the 1052 console typewriter from the IBM 1050 Teleprocessing System. All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The paper tape punch from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price. Optical Character Recognition OCR devices 1287 and latter the 1288 were available on the 360s. The 1287 could read handwritten numerals, some OCR fonts, and cash register OCR paper tape reels. The 1288 page reader could handle up to legal size OCR font typewritten pages, as well as handwritten numerals. Both of these OCR devices employed a flying spot scanning principle, with the raster scan provided by a large CRT, and the reflected light density changes were picked up by a high gain photomultiplier tube. MICR  Magnetic Ink Character Recognition  was provided by the IBM 1412 and 1419 Cheque Sorters, with Magnetic Ink Printing for cheque books on 1445 Printers a modified 1443 that used an MICR ribbon. 14121419 and 1445 were mainly used by Banking Institutions. Remaining machines  edit  Despite having been sold or leased in very large numbers for a mainframe system of its era only a few of System360 computers remain mainly as non-operating property of museums or collectors. Examples of existing systems include The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California has a non-working Model 30 on display, as do the Museum of Transport and Technology Motat in Auckland, New Zealand and the Vienna University of Technology in Austria. The University of Western Australia Computer Club has a complete Model 40 in storage. 43  The control panel of a Model 65, from a complex of System360 model types built for the FAA as the IBM 9020 , is on display in the Computer Science department of Stanford University . 44  In its maximum configuration it could comprise up to 12 System360 Model 65s and Model 50s. It was manufactured in 1971 and decommissioned in 1993. 44  The KCG Computer Museum of Kyoto Computer Gakuin, Japans first computer school in town, has an IBM System360 Model 40 on display. 45  A Model 20 and numerous peripherals in Nrnberg, Germany was purchased on ebay in AprilMay 2019 for 3710 by three UK enthusiasts who are moving the machine to Buckinghamshire. The system was in a small, abandoned building left untouched for decades, and apparently had been used in that building since all peripherals were still fully wired and interconnected. 46  A running list of remaining System360s can be found at World Inventory of remaining System360 CPUs . Gallery  edit  This gallery shows the operators console , with register value lamps, toggle switches middle of pictures, and  emergency pull  switch upper right of pictures of the various models. Model 30 Model 40 Model 50 Model 65 Model 67 Model 85 Model 91 In popular culture  edit  In the US television series Mad Men 20072015, the IBM 360 was featured as a plot device in which a company leased the system to the advertising agency and was a prominent background in the seventh season . A crowdfunding campaign for rescuing and restoring an IBM 360 system from Nuremberg has received successful funding. 47  See also  edit  History of IBM List of IBM products IBM System4 Pi Gerrit Blaauw Bob O. Evans Notes  edit   The RCA Spectra 70 had radically different architecture for interrupts and IO. There were compatibility packages to allow operating systems for System360 to run on a Spectra70 and vice versa.  Intended for real-time processing, the English Electric System 4 employed four processor states, each with its own set of general purpose registers. Instructions available in the user state were identical to the System 360. The other states were entered according to the class or severity of interrupt. The fourth the highest state was entered when power failure was imminent, and enabled the processor to shut itself down in an orderly fashion.

Using commercial instruction mix ADP Mix  In System360 architecture bit 12 of the program status word PSW controlled selection between the EBCDIC or a then proposed ASCII-8 mode signed decimal data. The proposed ASCII-8 ANSI standard was in the approval process when System360 was announced but it was subsequently rejected and no ASCII peripheral devices were made available. This capability was not included in System370 bit 12 of the PSW was redefined to switch between System360 BC mode and System370 EC mode PSW format.  However, it could still be ordered, and a TSS370 PRPQ was available on the S370 and went through multiple releases. References  edit   IBM System360 Dates and Characteristics . IBM. 2003-01-23.
