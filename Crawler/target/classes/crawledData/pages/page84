Data-center management From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Technical support  Jump to navigation Jump to search Data-center management 1  is the collection of tasks performed by those responsible for managing ongoing operation of a data center 2  This includes Business service management and planning for the future. Historically, data-center management was seen as something performed by employees, with the help of tools collectively called Data Center Infrastructure Management DCIM tools. 3  Now an outsourcing option exists Data-center Management As A Service - DMaaS . 4  Both for in-house operation and outsourcing, Service-level agreements must be managed to ensure data-availability. 5  Contents 1 Coopetition 2 Focus 2.1 Business-service management 3 Newer developments 4 Data-center asset management 4.1 Hardware-Asset Management 5 Data-center infrastructure management 6 Operations 7 Tech Support 7.1 Help desk professionalism 7.2 Outsourcing technical support 7.3 Scams 8 Preventive maintenance 9 Managing the capacity of a data center 10 Top data centers and service providers 11 See also 12 References 13 External links Coopetition  edit  Data-center management is a growing major topic for a growing list of large companies who both compete and cooperate, including Dell, 6  Google, 7  HP, 8  IBM, 7  Intel 8  and Yahoo. 8  Hardwaresoftware vendors who are willing to live with coopetition 9  10  are working on projects such as The Distributed Management Task Force DMTF 11  with a goal of learning to more effectively manage mixed Linux, Windows and cloud environments. With the DMTF a decade old, the list of companies is growing, and also includes companies much smaller than IBM, Microsoft, et al. 12  Focus  edit  Among the topics currently being explored are 13  scalability , securing data center networks, disaster recovery , government restrictions. 14  . Another major area is the cost of downtime regarding customer dissatisfaction  business loss, 15  and also the astonishing yet hidden cost and effect regarding personnel  productivity. 16  Business-service management  edit  Business-service management  BSM  treats IT as part of the larger enterprise strategy, 17  and helps fill the gap between Business  IT. 18  IBM notes that major problems often happen in the grey areas, particularly due to errors in the interfaces, and focuses on critical failures. Sufficient redundancy should allow failures in non-critical areas to protect the business from being affected. 18  BSM, which is positioned above IT Service Management ITSM, promotes a customer-centric and business-focused approach to service management , aligning business objectives with IT or ICT from strategy through to operations . Tools that help BSM include a modeling language, 19  and a common dashboard, which together allow data center personnel to see problems before business customers do. 20  Newer developments  edit  Remote Data-Center Management 21  allows offsite experts to watch for situations needing their timely intervention at a lower cost than having such staff be onsite 247365. While some requirements for on-site hardware have been reduced, 22  spending in other hardware areas such as UPS may have to increase. 23  Data-center asset management  edit  Data-center asset management also referred to as inventory management  24  is the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making for the IT environment. Assets include all elements of software and hardware that are found in the business environment. 25  Hardware-Asset Management  edit  Hardware asset management entails the management of the physical components of computers and computer networks , from acquisition through disposal. Common business practices include request and approval process, procurement management, life cycle management, redeployment and disposal management. A key component is capturing the financial information about the hardware life cycle which aids the organization in making business decisions based on meaningful and measurable financial objectives. Software Asset Management is a similar process, focusing on software assets, including licenses. Standards for this aspect of data center management are part of ISOIEC 19770 . IT asset management generally uses automation, to manage the discovery of assets, so inventory can be compared to license entitlements. Full business management of IT assets requires a repository of multiple types of information about the asset, as well as integration with other systems such as supply chain , help desk , procurement and HR systems and ITSM. Data-center infrastructure management  edit  Data-center-infrastructure management  DCIM  is the integration 26  of information technology IT and facility management disciplines 27  to centralize monitoring, management and intelligent capacity planning of a data centers critical systems. Achieved through the implementation of specialized software, hardware and sensors, DCIM enables common, real-time monitoring and management platform for all interdependent systems across IT and facility infrastructures. DCIM products can help data center managers identify and eliminate sources of risk 28  and improve availability of critical IT systems. They can also be used to identify interdependencies between facility and IT infrastructures to alert the facility manager to gaps in system redundancy, and provide dynamic, holistic benchmarks on power consumption and efficiency to measure the effectiveness of green IT initiatives. 29  30  Important data center metrics include those regarding energy efficiency and utilization of servers, storage, and staff. In too many cases, disc capacity is vastly under-utilized and servers run at 20 utilization or less. 31  More effective automation tools can also improve the number of servers or virtual machines that a single admin can handle. DCIM providers are increasingly linking with computational fluid dynamics providers to predict complex airflow patterns in the data center. The CFD component is necessary to quantify the impact of planned future changes on cooling resilience, capacity and efficiency. 32  Operations  edit  Operations ops Information technology operations , or IT operations , are the set of all processes and services that are both provisioned by an IT staff 33  to their internal or external clients and used by themselves, to run themselves as a business . The term refers to the application of operations management to a businesss technology needs. 34  Operations work can include responding to tickets generated for maintenance work or customer issues. 35  Some operations teams rely on on-call responses to incidents during off-hours periods. 35  As lights out 36  operations increased, less of the staff are located near corporate headquarters. 37  38  Gartner defines IT operations as the people and management processes associated with IT service management to deliver the right set of services at the right quality and at competitive costs for customers. 39  Tech Support  edit  Help desk redirects here. For the webcomic, see Help Desk webcomic . For Wikipedias help desk, see WikipediaHelp desk . A library help desk Corporate help desks 40  often arrange their Tech Support structure as a three-tier plus two system 41  Tier 1 Basic help desk - initial point of contact , including software opening a trouble ticket . Information available to its personnel include FAQ and a basic knowledge base . Tier 2 In-depth technical support Tier 3 Expert product and service support. The extra tiers are 41  Tier 0 Self help i.e. by the end user  Tier 4 Outside support for items not directly serviced by the organization Access to varying levels of support for products and services to in-house employees and corporate customers, providing information and troubleshooting 42  is via various channels such as toll-free numbers, 43  websites, instant messaging, or email. Help desk professionalism  edit  An ITIL -compliant help desk is usually a part of a bigger Service desk unit, which is part of ITSM 44  As the incoming phone calls are random in nature, help desk agent schedules are often maintained using an Erlang C calculation. Companies with custom application software may also have an applications team who are responsible for the development of in-house software. The help desk may assign to the applications team such problems as finding software bugs . Requests for new features or information about the capabilities of in-house software that come through the help desk are also assigned to applications groups. The help desk staff and supporting IT staff may not all work from the same location. With remote access applications , technicians are able to solve many help desk issues from another work location or their home office. While there is still a need for on-site support to effectively collaborate on some issues, remote support provides greater flexibility. AT T Mobility previously provided technical support for some of its mobile phones through Device Support Centers. Technical support often shortened to tech support  refers to services . Some fee-based service companies charge for premium technical support services. 45  Some companies and organizations provide discussion boards for users of their products to interact such forums allow companies to reduce their support costs 46  without losing the benefit of customer feedback. Outsourcing technical support  edit  Many organizations relocated their technical support departments or call centers to countries or regions with lower costs. Dell was amongst the first companies to outsource their technical support and customer service departments to India in 2001, but then reshored . 47  There has also been a growth in companies specializing in providing technical support to other organizations. These are often referred to as MSPs Managed Service Providers. 48  For businesses needing to provide technical support, outsourcing allows them to maintain a high availability of service. Such need may result from peaks in call volumes during the day, periods of high activity due to introduction of new products or maintenance service packs, or the requirement to provide customers with a high level of service at a low cost to the business. It allows businesses to utilize specialized personnel whose technica l knowledge base and experience may exceed the scope of the business, thus providing a higher level of technical support to their employees. Scams  edit  Main article Technical support scam A common scam typically involves a cold caller claiming to be from a technical support department of a company like Microsoft . Such cold calls are often made from call centers based in India to users in English-speaking countries , although increasingly these scams operate within the same country. The scammer will instruct the user to download a remote desktop program and once connected, use social engineering techniques that typically involve Windows components to persuade the victim that they need to pay in order for the computer to be fixed and then proceeds to steal money from the victims credit card. 49  Preventive maintenance  edit  Main article Preventive maintenance Preventive maintenance or preventative 50  maintenance  PM  is ongoing scheduled 51  inspection 52  intended to detect and correct incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major problems such as downtime. Managing the capacity of a data center  edit  Capacity of a datacenter - Life Cycle With the increasing use of the cloud and what has been called the Era of Infinite Capacity, 53  there is still a need for professional Data Center Capacity Planners. 54  There is a need to know what will be needed, and when. 55  Data must continually be collected regarding usage of powerenergy, computing power, data storage and networkingtelecommunications. Plans must include awareness of cooling and space requirements. Sometimes analysis of this data, and comparison to industry norms, can be outsourced . 55  The balance for the need to focus more on data collection 56  or analysis depends on current utilization levels prior to 50, the focus can stay more on data collection. Beyond 75, the focus must shift to analysis, in preparation for upgrades, replacements and expansions. The data center is a resource in its own right. 57  Top data centers and service providers  edit  According to Cloudscenes Leaderboard for Q1 2018, data center operators are ranked based on both data center density total operated data centers, as well as the number of listed service providers in the facility. Cloud service providers are ranked based on connectivity the total number of PoPs for the region.
