Consistency From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For other uses, see Consistency disambiguation . In classical deductive logic , a consistent theory is one that does not entail a contradiction . 1  2  The lack of contradiction can be defined in either semantic or syntactic terms. The semantic definition states that a theory is consistent if it has a model , i.e., there exists an interpretation under which all formulas in the theory are true. This is the sense used in traditional Aristotelian logic , although in contemporary mathematical logic the term satisfiable is used instead. The syntactic definition states a theory T displaystyle T is consistent if there is no formula  displaystyle varphi  such that both  displaystyle varphi  and its negation   displaystyle lnot varphi  are elements of the set of consequences of T displaystyle T . Let A displaystyle A be a set of closed sentences informally axioms and  A  displaystyle langle Arangle  the set of closed sentences provable from A displaystyle A under some specified, possibly implicitly formal deductive system. The set of axioms A displaystyle A is consistent when  ,     A  displaystyle varphi ,lnot varphi in langle Arangle  for no formula  displaystyle varphi  . 3  If there exists a deductive system for which these semantic and syntactic definitions are equivalent for any theory formulated in a particular deductive logic , the logic is called complete .  citation needed  The completeness of the sentential calculus was proved by Paul Bernays in 1918  citation needed  4  and Emil Post in 1921, 5  while the completeness of predicate calculus was proved by Kurt Gdel in 1930, 6  and consistency proofs for arithmetics restricted with respect to the induction axiom schema were proved by Ackermann 1924, von Neumann 1927 and Herbrand 1931. 7  Stronger logics, such as second-order logic , are not complete. A consistency proof is a mathematical proof that a particular theory is consistent. 8  The early development of mathematical proof theory was driven by the desire to provide finitary consistency proofs for all of mathematics as part of Hilberts program . Hilberts program was strongly impacted by incompleteness theorems , which showed that sufficiently strong proof theories cannot prove their own consistency provided that they are in fact consistent. Although consistency can be proved by means of model theory, it is often done in a purely syntactical way, without any need to reference some model of the logic. The cut-elimination or equivalently the normalization of the underlying calculus if there is one implies the consistency of the calculus since there is no cut-free proof of falsity, there is no contradiction in general.

A theory is complete if, for every formula  in its language, at least one of  or  is a logical consequence of the theory. Presburger arithmetic is an axiom system for the natural numbers under addition. It is both consistent and complete. Gdels incompleteness theorems show that any sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theory of arithmetic cannot be both complete and consistent. Gdels theorem applies to the theories of Peano arithmetic PA and primitive recursive arithmetic PRA, but not to Presburger arithmetic . Moreover, Gdels second incompleteness theorem shows that the consistency of sufficiently strong recursively enumerable theories of arithmetic can be tested in a particular way. Such a theory is consistent if and only if it does not prove a particular sentence, called the Gdel sentence of the theory, which is a formalized statement of the claim that the theory is indeed consistent. Thus the consistency of a sufficiently strong, recursively enumerable, consistent theory of arithmetic can never be proven in that system itself. The same result is true for recursively enumerable theories that can describe a strong enough fragment of arithmetic including set theories such as ZermeloFraenkel set theory . These set theories cannot prove their own Gdel sentenceprovided that they are consistent, which is generally believed. Because consistency of ZF is not provable in ZF, the weaker notion relative consistency is interesting in set theory and in other sufficiently expressive axiomatic systems. If T is a theory and A is an additional axiom , T  A is said to be consistent relative to T or simply that A is consistent with T  if it can be proved that if T is consistent then T  A is consistent. If both A and  A are consistent with T , then A is said to be independent of T .

First, that  displaystyle sim  is in fact an equivalence relation . Then, it needs to be verified that 1, 2, and 3 are well defined. This falls out of the fact that  displaystyle sim  is an equivalence relation and also requires a proof that 1 and 2 are independent of the choice of t 0 ,  , t n  1 displaystyle t_0,ldots ,t_n-1 class representatives. Finally, I    displaystyle mathfrak I_Phi vDash varphi  can be verified by induction on formulas. Model theory  edit  In ZFC set theory with classical first-order logic , 10  an inconsistent theory T displaystyle T is one such that there exists a closed sentence  displaystyle varphi  such that T displaystyle T contains both  displaystyle varphi  and its negation   displaystyle varphi  . A consistent theory is one such that the following logically equivalent conditions hold   ,     T displaystyle varphi ,varphi not subseteq T 11     T    T displaystyle varphi not in Tlor varphi not in T See also  edit  Wikiquote has quotations related to Consistency Look up consistency in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. Equiconsistency Hilberts problems Hilberts second problem Jan ukasiewicz Paraconsistent logic -consistency Gentzens consistency proof Proof by contradiction Footnotes  edit   Tarski 1946 states it this way A deductive theory is called CONSISTENT or NON-CONTRADICTORY if no two asserted statements of this theory contradict each other, or in other words, if of any two contradictory sentences . . . at least one cannot be proved, p. 135 where Tarski defines contradictory as follows With the help of the word not one forms the NEGATION of any sentence two sentences, of which the first is a negation of the second, are called CONTRADICTORY SENTENCES p. 20. This definition requires a notion of proof. Gdel in his 1931 defines the notion this way The class of provable formulas is defined to be the smallest class of formulas that contains the axioms and is closed under the relation immediate consequence, i.e., formula c of a and b is defined as an immediate consequence in terms of modus ponens or substitution cf Gdel 1931 van Heijenoort 1967601. Tarski defines proof informally as statements follow one another in a definite order according to certain principles . . . and accompanied by considerations intended to establish their validitytrue conclusion for all true premises -- Reichenbach 194768 cf Tarski 19463. Kleene 1952 defines the notion with respect t o either an induction or as to paraphrase a finite sequence of formulas such that each formula in the sequence is either an axiom or an immediate consequence of the preceding formulas A proof is said to be a proof of its last formula, and this formula is said to be formally provable or be a formal theorem cf Kleene 195283.  see Paraconsistent logic  Let L displaystyle L be a signature, T displaystyle T a theory in L   displaystyle L_infty omega  and  displaystyle varphi  a sentence in L   displaystyle L_infty omega  . We say that  displaystyle varphi  is a consequence of T displaystyle T , or that T displaystyle T entails  displaystyle varphi  , in symbols T   displaystyle Tvdash varphi  , if every model of T displaystyle T is a model of  displaystyle varphi  . In particular if T displaystyle T has no models then T displaystyle T entails  displaystyle varphi  . Warning  we dont require that if T   displaystyle Tvdash varphi  then there is a proof of  displaystyle varphi  from T displaystyle T . In any case, with infinitary languages its not always clear what would constitute a proof. Some writers use T   displaystyle Tvdash varphi  to mean that  displaystyle varphi  is deducible from T displaystyle T in some particular formal proof calculus, and they write T   displaystyle Tmodels varphi  for our notion of entailment a notation which clashes with our A   displaystyle Amodels varphi  . For first-order logic the two kinds of entailment coincide by the completeness theorem for the proof calculus in question. We say that  displaystyle varphi  is valid , or is a logical theorem , in symbols   displaystyle vdash varphi  , if  displaystyle varphi  is true in every L displaystyle L -structure. We say that  displaystyle varphi  is consistent if  displaystyle varphi  is true in some L displaystyle L -structure. Likewise we say that a theory T displaystyle T is consistent if it has a model. We say that two theories S and T in L infinity omega are equivalent if they have the same models, i.e. if ModS  ModT. Please note definition of ModT on p. 30 ... A Shorter Model Theory by Wilfrid Hodges, p. 37  van Heijenoort 1967265 states that Bernays determined the independence of the axioms of Principia Mathematica , a result not published until 1926, but he says nothing about Bernays proving their consistency .  Post proves both consistency and completeness of the propositional calculus of PM, cf van Heijenoorts commentary and Posts 1931 Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions in van Heijenoort 1967264ff. Also Tarski 1946134ff.  cf van Heijenoorts commentary and Gdels 1930 The completeness of the axioms of the functional calculus of logic in van Heijenoort 1967582ff  cf van Heijenoorts commentary and Herbrands 1930 On the consistency of arithmetic in van Heijenoort 1967618ff.  Informally, ZermeloFraenkel set theory is ordinarily assumed some dialects of informal mathematics customarily assume the axiom of choice in addition.  This definition is indepentent of the choice of t i displaystyle t_i due to the substitutivity properties of  displaystyle equiv  and the maximal consistency of  displaystyle Phi  .  the common case in many applications to other areas of mathematics as well as the ordinary mode of reasoning of informal mathematics in calculus and applications to physics, chemistry, engineering  according to De Morgans laws References  edit  Stephen Kleene , 1952 10th impression 1991, Introduction to Metamathematics , North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterday, New York, .mw-parser-output cite.citationfont-styleinherit.mw-parser-output .citation qquotes.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lock-green.svg9px-Lock-green.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation . cs1-lock-registration abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lock-gray-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLock-red-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-po sitionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registrationcolor555.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration spanborder-bottom1px dottedcursorhelp.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisource-logo.svg12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.pngno -repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output code.cs1-codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginherit.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-errordisplaynonefont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-errorfont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33margin-left0.3em.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-o utput .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-formatfont-size95.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-leftpadding-left0.2em.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-rightpadding-right0.2em ISBN   0-7204-2103-9 .
