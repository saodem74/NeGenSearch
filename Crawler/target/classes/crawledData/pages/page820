PubMed From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Redirected from PubMed Identifier  Jump to navigation Jump to search Not to be confused with PubMed Central . Online database with abstracts of medical articles, hosted by US National Library of Medicine PubMed Contact Research center United States National Library of Medicine NLM Release date January  1996  23  years ago   1996-01  Access Website www .ncbi .nlm .nih .gov pubmed  PubMed is a free search engine accessing primarily the MEDLINE database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics. The United States National Library of Medicine NLM at the National Institutes of Health maintains the database as part of the Entrez system of information retrieval . 1  From 1971 to 1997, MEDLINE online access to the MEDLARS Online computerized database primarily had been through institutional facilities, such as university libraries . PubMed, first released in January 1996, ushered in the era of private, free, home- and office-based MEDLINE searching. 2  The PubMed system was offered free to the public starting in June 1997. 3  .mw-parser-output .toclimit-2 .toclevel-1 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-3 .toclevel-2 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-4 .toclevel-3 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-5 .toclevel-4 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-6 .toclevel-5 ul,.mw-parser-output .toclimit-7 .toclevel-6 uldisplaynone Contents 1 Content 2 Characteristics 2.1 Standard searches 2.2 Comprehensive searches 2.3 Journal article parameters 2.3.1 Publication Type Clinical queriessystematic reviews 2.3.2 Secondary ID 2.4 See also 2.5 Mapping to MeSH 2.6 My NCBI 2.7 LinkOut 2.8 PubMed Commons 2.9 PubMed for handheldsmobiles 2.10 askMEDLINE 2.11 PubMed identifier 3 Alternative interfaces 4 Data mining of PubMed 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Content  edit  In addition to MEDLINE, PubMed provides access to older references from the print version of Index Medicus , back to 1951 and earlier references to some journals before they were indexed in Index Medicus and MEDLINE, for instance Science , BMJ , and Annals of Surgery very recent entries to records for an article before it is indexed with Medical Subject Headings MeSH and added to MEDLINE a collection of books available full-text and other subsets of NLM records 4  PMC citations NCBI Bookshelf Many PubMed records contain links to full text articles, some of which are freely available, often in PubMed Central 5  and local mirrors such as UK PubMed Central . 6  Information about the journals indexed in MEDLINE, and available through PubMed, is found in the NLM Catalog. 7  As of 6  December  2018 update  , PubMed has more than 29.1 million records going back to 1966, selectively to the year 1865, and very selectively to 1809 about 500,000 new records are added each year. As of the same date update  , 13.1 million of PubMeds records are listed with their abstracts, and 14.2 million articles have links to full-text of which 3.8 million articles are available, full-text for free for any user. 8  Approximately 12 of the records in PubMed correspond to cancer-related entries, which have grown from 6 in the 1950s to 16 in 2016. 9  Other significant proportion of records correspond to chemistry 8.69, therapy 8.39, and infection 5.  citation needed  In 2016, NLM changed the indexing system so that publishers will be able to directly correct typos and errors in PubMed indexed articles. 10  PubMed has been reported to include some articles published in predatory journals. MEDLINE and PubMed policies for the selection of journals for database inclusion are slightly different. Weaknesses in the criteria and procedures for indexing journals in PubMed Central may allow publications from predatory journals to leak into PubMed. 11  Characteristics  edit  Standard searches  edit  Simple searches on PubMed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into PubMeds search window. PubMed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names, relevant MeSH Medical Subject Headings terms, synonyms, Boolean operators, and nests the resulting terms appropriately, enhancing the search formulation significantly, in particular by routinely combining using the OR operator textwords and MeSH terms. The examples given in a PubMed tutorial 12  demonstrate how this automatic process works .mw-parser-output .templatequoteoverflowhiddenmargin1em 0padding0 40px.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequoteciteline-height1.5emtext-alignleftpadding-left1.6emmargin-top0 Causes Sleep Walking is translated as etiologySubheading OR etiologyAll Fields OR causesAll Fields OR causalityMeSH Terms OR causalityAll Fields AND somnambulismMeSH Terms OR somnambulismAll Fields OR sleepAll Fields AND walkingAll Fields OR sleep walkingAll Fields Likewise, soft Attack Aspirin Prevention is translated as myocardial infarctionMeSH Terms OR myocardialAll Fields AND infarctionAll Fields OR myocardial infarctionAll Fields OR heartAll Fields AND attackAll Fields OR heart attackAll Fields AND aspirinMeSH Terms OR aspirinAll Fields AND prevention and controlSubheading OR preventionAll Fields AND controlAll Fields OR prevention and controlAll Fields OR preventionAll Fields A new PubMed interface was launched in October 2009 and encouraged the use of such quick, Google-like search formulations they have also been described as telegram searches. 13  By default the results are sorted by Most Recent, but this can be changed to Best Match, Publication Date, First Author, Last Author, Journal, or Title. 14  Comprehensive searches  edit  For optimal searches in PubMed, it is necessary to understand its core component, MEDLINE, and especially of the MeSH Medical Subject Headings controlled vocabulary used to index MEDLINE articles. They may also require complex search strategies, use of field names tags, proper use of limits and other features reference librarians and search specialists offer search service s. 15  16  The search into PubMeds search window is only recommended for the search of unequivocal topics or new interventions that do not yet have a MeSH heading created, as well as for the search for commercial brands of medicines and proper noun. It is also useful when there is no suitable heading or the descriptor represents a partial aspect. The search using the thesaurus MeSH is mo re accurate and will give us less irrelevant results. In addition, it saves the disadvantage of the free text search in which the spelling, singularplural or abbreviated differences have to be taken into consideration. On the other side, we will lose those articles more recently incorporated into the database to which descriptors have not yet been assigned. Therefore, to guara ntee an exhaustive search, we must use a combination of controlled language headings and free text terms. 17  Journal article parameters  edit  When a journal article is indexed, numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information. Such parameters are Article Type MeSH terms, e.g., Clinical Trial, Secondary identifiers, MeSH terms, Language, Country of the Journal or publication history e-publication date, print journal publication date. Publication Type Clinical queriessystematic reviews  edit  Publication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication , including reports of various kinds of clinical research. 18  Secondary ID  edit  Since July 2005, the MEDLINE article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called Secondary Identifier SI. The secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data, gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial IDs. For clinical trials, PubMed extracts trial IDs for the two largest trial registries ClinicalTrials.gov NCT identifier and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register IRCTN identifier. 19  See also  edit  A reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and related articles can be identified. If relevant, several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated on PubMed or any of the other NCBI Entrez databases using the Find related data option. The related articles are then listed in order of relatedness. To create these list s of related articles, PubMed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation, as well as the MeSH headings assigned, using a powerful word-weighted algorithm. 20  The related articles function has been judged to be so precise that the authors of a paper suggested it can be used instead of a full search. 21  Mapping to MeSH  edit  PubMed automatically links to MeSH terms and subheadings. Examples would be bad breath links to and includes in the search halitosis, heart attack to myocardial infarction, breast cancer to breast neoplasms. Where appropriate, these MeSH terms are automatically expanded, that is, include more specific terms. Terms like nursing are automatically linked to Nur sing MeSH or Nursing Subheading. This feature is called Auto Term Mapping and is enacted, by default, in free text searching but not exact phrase searching i.e. enclosing the search query with double quotes. 22  This feature makes PubMed searches more sensitive and avoids false-negative missed hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminology. 22  PubMed does not apply automatic mapping of the term in the following circumstances by writing the quoted phrase e.g., kidney allograft, when truncated on the asterisk e.g., kidney allograft, and when looking with field labels e.g., Cancer ti. 17  My NCBI  edit  The PubMed optional facility My NCBI with free registration provides tools for saving searches filtering search results setting up automatic updates sent by e-mail saving sets of references retrieved as part of a PubMed search configuring display formats or highlighting search terms and a wide range of other options. 23  The My NCBI area can be accessed from any computer with web-access. An earlier version of My NCBI was called PubMed Cubby. 24  LinkOut  edit  LinkOut, a NLM facility to link and make available full-text local journal holdings. 25  Some 3,200 sites mainly academic institutions participate in this NLM facility as of March  2010 update  , from Aalborg University in Denmark to ZymoGenetics in Seattle. 26  Users at these institutions see their institutions logo within the PubMed search result if the journal is held at that institution and can access the full-text. Link out is being consolidated with Outside Tool as of the major platform update coming in the Summer of 2019. 27  PubMed Commons  edit  In 2016, PubMed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by PubMed. This feature was initially tested in a pilot mode since 2013 and was made permanent in 2016. 28  In February 2018, PubMed Commons was discontinued due to the fact that usage has remained minimal. 29  30  PubMed for handheldsmobiles  edit  PubMedMEDLINE can be accessed via handheld devices, using for instance the PICO option for focused clinical questions created by the NLM. 31  A PubMed Mobile option, providing access to a mobile friendly, simplified PubMed version, is also available. 32  askMEDLINE  edit  askMEDLINE, a free-text, natural language query tool for MEDLINEPubMed, developed by the NLM, also suitable for handhelds. 33  PubMed identifier  edit  For help using PubMed identifiers within Wikipedia, see WikipediaPMID . A PMID PubMed identifier or PubMed unique identifier 34  is a unique integer value , starting at 1 , assigned to each PubMed record. A PMID is not the same as a PMCID  P ub M ed C entral id entifier which is the identifier for all works published in the free-to-access PubMed Central . 35  The assignment of a PMID or PMCID to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content. PMIDs are assigned to letters to the editor , editorial opinions, op-ed columns, and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal, as well as peer-reviewed papers. The existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud, incompetence, or misconduct. The announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a PMID. Each number that we enter in the PubMed search window is treated by default as if it were a PMID. Therefore, we can locate any reference in PubMed using the PMID. To do this we only have to enter the PMID number in the search window. Alternative interfaces  edit  MEDLINE is one of the databases which are accessible via PubMed. Several companies provide access to MEDLINE through their platforms. The National Library of Medicine leases the MEDLINE information to a number of private vendors such as Embase , Ovid , Dialog , EBSCO , Knowledge Finder and many other commercial, non-commercial, and academic providers. 36  As of October  2008 update  , more than 500 licenses had been issued, more than 200 of them to providers outside the United States. As licenses to use MEDLINE data are available for free, the NLM in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range 37  of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to PubMed, one of a very few large, professionally curated databases which offers this option. Lu 37  identifies a sample of 28 current and free Web-based PubMed versions, requiring no installation or registration, which are grouped into four categories Ranking search results, for instance eTBLAST  MedlineRanker 38  MiSearch 39  Clustering results by topics, authors, journals etc., for instance Anne OTate  40  ClusterMed 41  Enhancing semantics and visualization, for instance EBIMed 42  MedEvi. 43  Improved search interface and retrieval experience, for instance, askMEDLINE 44  45  BabelMeSH 46  and PubCrawler. 47  As most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on PubMedMEDLINE data leased under license from the NLMPubMed, the term PubMed derivatives has been suggested. 37  Without the need to store about 90  GB of original PubMed Datasets, anybody can write PubMed applications using the eutils-application program interface as described in The E-utilities In-Depth Parameters, Syntax and More, by Eric Sayers, PhD. 48  Various citation format generators, taking PMID numbers as input, are examples of web applications making use of the eutils-application program interface. Sample web pages include Citation Generator - Mick Schroeder , Pubmed Citation Generator - Ultrasound of the Week , PMID2cite , and Cite this for me . Data mining of PubMed  edit  Alternative methods to mine the data in PubMed use programming environments such as Matlab , Python or R . In these cases, queries of PubMed are written as lines of code and passed to PubMed and the response is then processed directly in the programming environment. Code can be automated to systematically queries with different keywords such as disease, year, organs, etc. A recent publication 2017 found that the proportion of cancer-related entries in PubMed has risen from 6 i n the 1950s to 16 in 2016. 9  The data accessible by PubMed can be mirrored locally using an unofficial tool such as MEDOC. 49  See also  edit  Arrowsmith System JournalReview.org References  edit   PubMed . .mw-parser-output cite.citationfont-styleinherit.mw-parser-output .citation qquotes.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-free abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb665Lock-green.svg9px-Lock-green.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .citation . cs1-lock-registration abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbdd6Lock-gray-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-gray-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .citation .cs1-lock-subscription abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumbaaaLock-red-alt-2.svg9px-Lock-red-alt-2.svg.pngno-repeatbackground-po sitionright .1em center.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registrationcolor555.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription span,.mw-parser-output .cs1-registration spanborder-bottom1px dottedcursorhelp.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon abackgroundurlupload.wikimedia.orgwikipediacommonsthumb44cWikisource-logo.svg12px-Wikisource-logo.svg.pngno -repeatbackground-positionright .1em center.mw-parser-output code.cs1-codecolorinheritbackgroundinheritborderinheritpaddinginherit.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-errordisplaynonefont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-errorfont-size100.mw-parser-output .cs1-maintdisplaynonecolor33aa33margin-left0.3em.mw-parser-output .cs1-subscription,.mw-parser-o utput .cs1-registration,.mw-parser-output .cs1-formatfont-size95.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-leftpadding-left0.2em.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right,.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-wl-rightpadding-right0.2em  PubMed Celebrates its 10th Anniversary .
