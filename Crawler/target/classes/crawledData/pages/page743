His elder brother was the mathematician Hans Samelson . Due to political circumstances, he waited until 1946 to study Mathematics and Physics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Munich . Career  edit  After graduating, he worked briefly as a high school teacher before he returned to university. He completed his doctorate degree in Physics with Fritz Bopp with a dissertation on a quantum mechanical problem posed by Arnold Sommerfeld related to Unipolar Induction . 2  Dr Samelson became interested in Numerical Analysis , and when Hans Piloty, an electrical engineer, and Robert Sauer, a professor of Mathematics, began working together, he joined and got involved in early computers as a research associate in the Mathematical Institute of the Technical University Munich . This changed his scientific career. His first publications came from Sauers interests dealing with supersonic flow and precision problems of digital computations for numerical calculations of Eigenvalues . Soon after, Samelsons strong influence began on the development of Computer Science and Informatics as a new scientific discipline. With Friedrich L. Bauer , who also had Fritz Bopp as his Ph.D. advisor, he studied the structure of programming languages in order to develop efficient algorithms for their translation and implementation. This research led to bracketed structures and it became clear to Samelson that this principle should govern the translation of programming languages and the run-time system with stack models and bloc k structure. It was a fundamental breakthrough in how computer systems are modeled and designed. Piloty, Bauer and Samelson had also worked on the design of PERM , a computer based partially on the Whirlwind concept. By 1955, the PERM was completed and they continued work that Bauer had begun in 1951 on concepts in automatic programming. Samelson played a key role in the design of ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. In 1958, he accepted a chair for Mathematics at the University of Mainz , and since 1963 he held a chair at the Technical University Munich where he and F.L. Bauer, began to develop a university curriculum for Informatics and Computer Science. He was involved with international standards in programming and informatics through IFIP . He became an editor of the journal Acta Informatica when it began in 1971. Selected publications  edit  Alan J.
