Architecturally significant requirements From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Redirected from Architecturally Significant Requirements  Jump to navigation Jump to search type of requirement in systems engineering Architecturally significant requirements are those requirements that have a measurable effect on a computer systems architecture . 1  This can comprise both software and hardware requirements. They are a subset of requirements , the subset that affects the architecture of a system in measurably identifiable ways.

When talking about architecture, non-functional requirements or quality attributes is often used. 2  However, recent empirical studies show that, for a software system , not all non-functional requirements affect its architecture , and requirements that are not non-functional requirements can also affect its architecture. 1  3  So, architecturally significant requirements is a valuable notion that is suggested to use when talking about requirements in relation to architecture. 3  Characteristics  edit  Architecturally significant requirements can be characterized from the following aspects. 1  Descriptive characteristics  edit  Architecturally significant requirements are often hard to define and articulate, tend to be expressed vaguely, tend to be initially neglected, tend to be hidden within other requirements, and are subjective, variable, and situational. Other requirements could also demonstrate these descriptive characteristics. However, architecturally significant requirements significance ma de these manifestations unique and challenging. Indicators  edit  A requirement that has wide effect, targets trade-off points, is strict constraining, limiting, non-negotiable, assumption breaking, or difficult to achieve is likely to be architecturally significant. Indicators for architectural significance that have been reported in the literature include The requirement is associated with high business value andor technical risk. The requirement is a concern of a particularly important influential, that is stakeholder. The requirement has a first-of-a-kind character, e.g. none of the responsibilities of already existing components in the architecture addresses it. The requirement has QoSSLA characteristics that deviate from all ones that are already satisfied by the evolving architecture. The requirement has caused budget overruns or client dissatisfaction in a previous project with a similar context. The OpenUP 4  and Peter Eeles IBM discusses additional criteria for architectural significance in several articles and presentations 5  Heuristics  edit  When a requirement specifies a software systems quality attributes , refers to a software systems core features, impose constraints on a software system , defines the environment in which the software system will run, it is likely to be architecturally significant. See discussion of design vs. architecture under software architecture for additional criteria of architectural significance. Elicitation  edit  Like all non-functional requirements and quality attribute 6  requirements, architecturally significant requirements should be specified in a SMART way. Quality attribute scenarios 2  are one way to achieve the Sspecific and the Measured criteria in SMART. The SEI  clarification needed  recommends Quality Attribute Workshops for this effort. 7  It has been suggested to keep architecture analysis and design lightweight and flexible quality attribute trees for certain application genres and technology domains can support such approaches. 8  It is important to communicate the elicited architecturally significant requirements, and any other architectural artifacts, in a notation and language that is comprehensible for the target audience hear business stakeholders . 9  Impact  edit  Architecturally significant requirements are used in software design to drive and justify architectural decisions  if not satisfied properly, they contribute to the accumulation of technical debt . For instance, failure to meet security and compliance requirements complicates the system and process assurance audits and increases the risk of audit findings. 10  Exemplary advice on how to address system quality attributes including architecturally significant requirements is available in the literature. 11  12  See also  edit  Architectural decision Architectural pattern Attribute-driven design List of system quality attributes Non-functional requirement Requirements engineering Software architecture Solution architecture Systems architecture References  edit   a b c Chen, Lianping Ali Babar, Muhammad Nuseibeh, Bashar 2013.
