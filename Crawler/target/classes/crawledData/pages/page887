This colorless, odorless, and hygroscopic crystalline solid is highly soluble in water . It is used in various skin-care products. Glycolic acid is found in some sugar-crops. A glycolate or glycollate is a salt or ester of glycolic acid.

He proposed that the amino acid glycine  which was then called glycocolle  might be the amine of a hypothetical acid, which he called glycolic acid  acide glycolique . 5  Glycolic acid was first prepared in 1851 by German chemist Adolph Strecker 18221871 and Russian chemist Nikolai Nikolaevich Sokolov 18261877. They produced it by treating hippuric acid with nitric acid and nitrogen dioxide to form an ester of benzoic acid and glycolic acid C 6 H 5 COOCH 2 COOH, which they called benzoglycolic acid  Benzoglykolsure , also benzoyl glycolic acid. They boiled the ester for days with dilute sulfuric acid , thereby obtaining benzoic acid and glycolic acid  Glykolsure . 6  7  Preparation  edit  Glycolic acid can be synthesized in various ways. The predominant approaches uses a catalyzed reaction of formaldehyde with synthesis gas  carbonylation of formaldehyde, for its low cost. 8  It is also prepared by the reaction of chloroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide followed by re-acidification. Other methods, not noticeably in use, include hydrogenation of oxalic acid , and hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin derived from formaldehyde . 9  Some of todays glycolic acids are formic acid -free. Glycolic acid can be isolated from natural sources, such as sugarcane , sugar beets , pineapple , cantaloupe and unripe grapes . 10  Glycolic acid can also be prepared using an enzymatic biochemical process that may require less energy. 11  Properties  edit  Glycolic acid is slightly stronger than acetic acid due to the electron-withdrawing power of the terminal hydroxyl group. The carboxylate group can coordinate to metal ions forming coordination complexes. Of particular note are the complexes with Pb 2 and Cu 2 which are significantly stronger than complexes with other carboxylic acids. This indicates that the hydroxyl group is involved in complex formation, possibly with the loss of its proton. 12  Applications  edit  Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent, 13  in food processing as a flavoring agent and as a preservative, and in the pharmaceutical industry as a skin care agent. It is also used in adhesives and plastics. 14  Glycolic acid is often included into emulsion polymers , solvents and additives for ink and paint in order to improve flow properties and impart gloss. It is used in surface treatment products that increase the coefficient of friction on tile flooring. It is the active ingredient in the household cleaning liquid Pine-Sol . Skin care  edit  This section needs more medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources . Please review the contents of the section and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed .  January 2019  Due to its capability to penetrate skin , glycolic acid finds applications in skin care products, most often as a chemical peel . Physician-strength peels can have a pH as low as 0.6 strong enough to completely keratolyze the epidermis, while acidities for home peels can be as low as 2.5. Once applied, glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of the epidermis , weakening the binding properties of the lipids that hold the dead skin cells together. This allows the stratum corneum to be exfoliated , exposing live skin cells. Organic synthesis  edit  Glycolic acid is a useful intermediate for organic synthesis, in a range of reactions including oxidation - reduction , esterification and long chain polymerization . It is used as a monomer in the preparation of polyglycolic acid and other biocompatible copolymers e.g. PLGA . Commercially, important derivatives include the methyl CAS 96-35-5 and ethyl CAS 623-50-7 esters which are readily distillable b.p.  147-9 and 158159  C, respectively, unlike the parent acid. The butyl ester b.p.  178186  C is a component of some varnishes , being desirable because it is nonvolatile and has good dissolving properties. 9  Agriculture  edit  Many plants make glycolic acid during photorespiration . Its role consumes significant amounts of energy. In 2017 researchers announced a process that employs a novel protein to reduce energy consumptionloss and prevent plants from releasing harmful ammonia . The process converts glycolate into glycerate without using the conventional BASS6 and PLGG1 route. 15  16  Safety  edit  Glycolic acid is a strong irritant depending on pH. 17  Like ethylene glycol , it is metabolized to oxalic acid , which could make it dangerous if ingested.

For their production of glycolic acid, see pp. 3437. Note Strecker and Sokolovs empirical formula for glycolic acid viz, C 4 H 4 O 6  was incorrect, because like many chemists at that time, they used the wrong atomic masses for carbon 6 instead of 12 and for oxygen 8 instead of 16.  Socoloff and Strecker, 1851, p. 37. In recognition of Laurents correct surmise, Strecker and Sokolov named glycolic acid Die in dem Barytsalz enthaltene Sure C 4 H 3 O 5 oder als Surehydrat gedacht C 4 H 4 O 6 kommt mit der Sure berein, als deren Amidverbindung man das Glycocoll betrachten kann, und welche daher von Laurent den Namen Glycolsure erhalten hat. The acid C 4 H 3 O 5 contained in the barium salt  or considered as the acid hydrate C 4 H 4 O 6  is consistent with the acid whose amide can be regarded as glycocoll and which therefore obtained from Laurent the name glycolic acid.
