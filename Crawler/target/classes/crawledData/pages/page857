His last name is the N in the BNF notation  Backus Naur form, used in the description of the syntax for most programming languages . He contributed to the creation of the ALGOL 60 programming language. Contents 1 Biography 2 Bibliography 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Biography  edit  Naur began his career as an astronomer for which he received his PhD degree in 1957, but his encounter with computers led to a change of profession. From 1959 to 1969, he was employed at Regnecentralen , the Danish computing company, while at the same time giving lectures at the Niels Bohr Institute and the Technical University of Denmark . From 1969 to 1998 Naur was a professor of computer science at University of Copenhagen . His main areas of inquiry were design, structure and performance of computer programs and algorithms . Areas such as software engineering and software architecture have also been pioneered by Naur. In his book Computing A Human Activity 1992, which is a collection of his contributions to computer science, he rejected the formalist school of programming that views programming as a branch of mathematics. He did not like being associated with the BackusNaur form attributed to him by Donald Knuth  and said that he would prefer it to be called the Backus normal form . Naur was married to computer scientist Christiane Floyd . Naur disliked the very term computer science and suggested it be called datalogy or  data science . The former term has been adopted in Denmark and in Sweden as datalogi , while the latter term is now used for data analysis including statistics and databases. Since the middle of the 1960s, computer science has been practiced in Denmark under Peter Naurs term datalogy, the science of data processes. Starting at Regnecentralen and the University of Copenhagen, the Copenhagen Tradition of Computer Science has developed its own special characteristics by means of a close connection with applications and other fields of knowledge. The t radition is not least visible in the area of education. Comprehensive project activity is an integral part of the curriculum, thus presenting theory as an aspect of realistic solutions known primarily through actual experience. Peter Naur early recognized the particular educational challenges presented by computer science. His innovations have shown their quality and vitality a lso at other universities. There is a close connection between computer science training as it has been formed at Copenhagen University, and the view of computer science which has characterized Peter Naurs research 2  . In later years he was quite outspoken of the pursuit of science as a whole Naur can possibly be identified with the empiricist school, that tells that one shall not seek deeper connections between things that manifest themselves in the world, but keep to the observable facts. He has attacked both certain strands of philosophy and psychology from this viewpoint. He was also developing a theory of human thinking which he called Synapse-State Theory of Mental Life. 3  Naur won the 2005 ACM A.M. Turing Award for his work on defining the ALGOL 60 programming language. 4  In particular, his role as editor of the influential Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60 with its pioneering use of BNF was recognized. Naur is the only Dane to have won the Turing Award. Naur died on 3 January 2016 after a short illness. 5  Bibliography  edit  Numbers refer to the published bibliography. Naur published a large number of articles and chapters on astronomy, computer science, issues in society, classical music, psychology, and education. 66.
