Glossary of aerospace engineering From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Most of the terms listed in Wikipedia glossaries are already defined and explained within Wikipedia itself. However, glossaries like this one are useful for looking up, comparing and reviewing large numbers of terms together. You can help enhance this page by adding new terms or writing definitions for existing ones. This glossary of aerospace engineering terms pertains specifically to aerospace engineering and its sub-disciplines. For a broad overview of engineering, see glossary of engineering . Contents    A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z See also References A  edit  Above ground level  In aviation , atmospheric sciences and broadcasting , a height above ground level  AGL 1   is a height measured with respect to the underlying ground surface . This is as opposed to altitudeelevation above mean sea level AMSL, or in broadcast engineering  height above average terrain HAAT. In other words, these expressions AGL, AMSL, HAAT indicate where the zero level or reference altitude is located. Absolute humidity  describes the water content of air and is expressed in either grams per cubic meter 2  or grams per kilogram 3  . Absolute value  In mathematics , the absolute value or modulus  x  of a real number   x is the non-negative value of   x without regard to its sign . Namely,  x   x for a positive   x ,  x    x for a negative   x in which case  x is positive, and 0  0 . For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of 3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero. Acceleration  In physics , acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time. An objects acceleration is the net result of any and all forces acting on the object, as described by Newtons Second Law . 4  The SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared m s 2 . Accelerations are vector quantities they have magnitude and direction  and add according to the parallelogram law . 5  6  As a vector , the calculated net force is equal to the product of the objects mass a scalar quantity and its acceleration. Acquisition of signal  A pass , in spaceflight and satellite communications , is the period in which a satellite or other spacecraft is above the local horizon and available for radio communication with a particular ground station , satellite receiver , or relay satellite or, in some cases, for visual sighting. The beginning of a pass is termed acquisition of signal  the end of a pass is termed loss of signal . 7  The point at which a spacecraft comes closest to a ground observer is the time of closest approach . 7  Action  In physics , action is an attribute of the dynamics of a physical system from which the equations of motion of the system can be derived. It is a mathematical functional which takes the trajectory , also called path or history , of the system as its argument and has a real number as its result. Generally, the action takes different values for different paths. 8  Action has the dimensions of energy  time or momentum  length , and its SI unit is joule -second. ADF Automatic direction finder Advanced Space Vision System  The Advanced Space Vision System also known as the Space Vision System or by its acronym SVS is a computer vision system designed primarily for International Space Station ISS assembly. 9  The system uses regular 2D cameras in the Space Shuttle bay, on the Canadarm , or on the ISS along with cooperative targets to calculate the 3D position of an object. 9  Aeroacoustics  Is a branch of acoustics that studies noise generation via either turbulent fluid motion or aerodynamic forces interacting with surfaces. Noise generation can also be associated with periodically varying flows. A notable example of this phenomenon is the Aeolian tones produced by wind blowing over fixed objects. Aerobraking  is a spaceflight maneuver that reduces the high point of an elliptical orbit  apoapsis  by flying the vehicle through the atmosphere at the low point of the orbit  periapsis . The resulting drag slows the spacecraft . Aerobraking is used when a spacecraft requires a low orbit after arriving at a body with an atmosphere, and it requires less fuel than does the direct use of a rocket engine . Aerocapture  is an orbital transfer maneuver used to reduce the velocity of a spacecraft from a hyperbolic trajectory to an elliptical orbit around the targeted celestial body. Aerodynamics  is the study of the motion of air , particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an airplane wing. It is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics , and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields. Aeroelasticity  is the branch of physics and engineering that studies the interactions between the inertial , elastic , and aerodynamic forces that occur when an elastic body is exposed to a fluid flow. Although historical studies have been focused on aeronautical applications, recent research has found applications in fields such as energy harvesting 10  and understanding snoring . 11  The study of aeroelasticity may be broadly classified into two fields static aeroelasticity, which deals with the static or steady response of an elastic body to a fluid flow and dynamic aeroelasticity, which deals with the bodys dynamic typically vibrational  response. Aeroelasticity draws on the study of fluid mechanics , solid mechanics , structural dynamics and dynamical systems . The synthesis of aeroelasticity with thermodynamics is known as aerothermoelasticity, and its synthesis with control theory is known as aeroservoelasticity. Aeronautics  Is the science or art involved with the study, design , and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere . Aerospace architecture  is broadly defined to encompass architectural design of non-habitable and habitable structures and living and working environments in aerospace-related facilities, habitats, and vehicles. These environments include, but are not limited to science platform aircraft and aircraft-deployable systems space vehicles , space stations , habitats and lunar and planetary surface construction bases and Earth-based control, experiment, launch, logistics, payload, simulation and test facilities. Earth analogs to space applications may include Antarctic, desert, high altitude, underground, undersea environments and closed ecological systems. Aerospace bearing  Aerospace bearings are the bearings installed in aircraft and aerospace systems including commercial, private, military, or space applications. Aerospace engineering  is the primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft . 12  It has two major and overlapping branches Aeronautical engineering and Astronautical Engineering. Avionics engineering is similar, but deals with the electronics side of aerospace engineering. Aerospace materials  are materials, frequently metal alloys , that have either been developed for, or have come to prominence through, their use for aerospace purposes. These uses often require exceptional performance, strength or heat resistance, even at the cost of considerable expense in their production or machining. Others are chosen for their long-term reliability in this safety-conscious field, particularly for their resistance to fatigue . Aerospike engine  is a type of rocket engine that maintains its aerodynamic efficiency across a wide range of altitudes . It belongs to the class of altitude compensating nozzle engines. A vehicle with an aerospike engine uses 2530 less fuel at low altitudes, where most missions have the greatest need for thrust . Aerostat  is a lighter than air aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered balloons and powered airships . Aerostructure  is a component of an aircraft s airframe. This may include all or part of the fuselage , wings , or flight control surfaces. Aft-crossing trajectory  is an alternate flight path for a rocket. The rockets rotation induced by the deployment from the aircraft is slowed by a small parachute attached to its tail, then ignited once the carrier aircraft has passed it. It is ignited before it is pointing fully vertically, however it will turn to do so, and accelerates to pass behind the carrier aircraft. AGL  Above ground level Aileron  is a hinged flight control surface usually forming part of the trailing edge of each wing of a fixed-wing aircraft . Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in roll or movement around the aircrafts longitudinal axis , which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the lift vector . Movement around this axis is called rolling or banking. Air-augmented rocket  Aircraft  is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air . It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil , 13  or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines . Common examples of aircraft include airplanes , helicopters , airships including blimps , gliders , and hot air balloons . 14  Aircraft flight control systems  A conventional fixed-wing aircraft flight control system consists of flight control surfaces , the respective cockpit controls, connecting linkages, and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircrafts direction in flight. Aircraft engine controls are also considered as flight controls as they change speed. Aircraft flight mechanics  Airfoil  An airfoil  American English  or aerofoil  British English  is the cross-sectional shape of a wing , blade of a propeller , rotor , or turbine , or sail as seen in cross-section . Airlock  is a device which permits the passage of people and objects between a pressure vessel and its surroundings while minimizing the change of pressure in the vessel and loss of air from it. The lock consists of a small chamber with two airtight doors in series which do not open simultaneously. Airship  An airship or dirigible balloon is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power. 15  Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. Albedo  is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body e.g. a planet like Earth . It is dimensionless and measured on a scale from 0 corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation to 1 corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation. Anemometer  is a device used for measuring wind speed , and is also a common weather station instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word anemos , which means wind , and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in meteorology . Angle of attack  In fluid dynamics , angle of attack  AOA , or  displaystyle alpha   is the angle between a reference line on a body often the chord line of an airfoil  and the vector representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving. 16  Angle of attack is the angle between the bodys reference line and the oncoming flow. Angular momentum  In physics , angular momentum rarely, moment of momentum or rotational momentum  is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum . It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torque . Angular velocity  In physics , the angular velocity of a particle is the rate at which it rotates around a chosen center point that is, the time rate of change of its angular displacement relative to the origin i.e. in laymans terms how quickly an object goes around something over a period of time - e.g. how fast the earth orbits the sun. It is measured in angle per unit time, radians per second in SI units, and is usually represented by the symbol omega   , sometimes  . By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise. Anticyclone  An anticyclone that is, opposite to a cyclone  is a weather phenomenon defined by the United States National Weather Service s glossary as a large-scale circulation of winds around a central region of high atmospheric pressure, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. 17  Antimatter rocket  is a proposed class of rockets that use antimatter as their power source. There are several designs that attempt to accomplish this goal. The advantage to this class of rocket is that a large fraction of the rest mass of a matterantimatter mixture may be converted to energy, allowing antimatter rockets to have a far higher energy density and specific impulse than any other proposed class of rocket. Apsis  is an extreme point in the orbit of an object . The word comes via Latin from Greek and is cognate with apse . 18  For elliptic orbits about a larger body, there are two apsides, named with the prefixes peri- from  peri , meaning near and ap-  apo- from  ap , meaning away from added to a reference to the body being orbited . Arcjet rocket  or arcjet thruster is a form of electrically powered spacecraft propulsion , in which an electrical discharge arc is created in a flow of propellant 19  20  typically hydrazine or ammonia . This imparts additional energy to the propellant, so that one can extract more work out of each kilogram of propellant, at the expense of increased power consumption and usually higher cost. Also, the thrust levels available from typically used arcjet engines are very low compared with chemical engines. Areal velocity  In classical mechanics , areal velocity also called sector velocity or sectorial velocity  is the rate at which area is swept out by a particle as it moves along a curve . Argument of periapsis  also called argument of perifocus or argument of pericenter , symbolized as  , is one of the orbital elements of an orbiting body. Parametrically,  is the angle from the bodys ascending node to its periapsis , measured in the direction of motion. ARP4761  Aspect ratio aeronautics  In aeronautics , the aspect ratio of a wing is the ratio of its span to its mean chord . It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio. 21  Aspect ratio and other features of the planform are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the lift-to-drag ratio increases with aspect ratio, improving fuel economy in aircraft . Asteroid  Asteroids are minor planets , especially of the inner Solar System . Larger asteroids have also been called planetoids . These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not resemble a planet-like disc and was not observed to have characteristics of an active comet such as a tail. As minor planets in the outer Solar System were discovered they were typically found to have volatile -rich surfaces similar to comets. As a result, they were often distinguished from objects found in the main asteroid belt . 22  Astrodynamics  Orbital mechanics or astrodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft . Atmospheric entry  is the movement of an object from outer space into and through the gases of an atmosphere of a planet , dwarf planet or natural satellite . There are two main types of atmospheric entry uncontrolled entry, such as the entry of astronomical objects , space debris or bolides  and controlled entry or reentry of a spacecraft capable of being navigated or following a predetermined course. Technologies and procedures allowing the controlled atmospheric entry, descent and landing of spacecraft are collectively termed as EDL . Attitude control  is controlling the orientation of an object with respect to an inertial frame of reference or another entity like the celestial sphere , certain fields, and nearby objects, etc. Controlling vehicle attitude requires sensors to measure vehicle orientation, actuators to apply the torques needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude, and algorithms to command the actuators based on 1 sensor measurements of the current attitude and 2 specification of a desired attitude. The integrated field that studies the combination of sensors, actuators and algorithms is called Guidance, Navigation and Control GNC. Automatic direction finder   ADF  is a marine or aircraft radio-navigation instrument that automatically and continuously displays the relative bearing from the ship or aircraft to a suitable radio station. 23  24  Avionics  are the electronic systems used on aircraft, artificial satellites , and spacecraft . Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. Axial stress  a normal stress parallel to the axis of cylindrical symmetry. B  edit  Balloon  In aeronautics , a balloon is an unpowered aerostat , which remains aloft or floats due to its buoyancy . A balloon may be free, moving with the wind, or tethered to a fixed point. It is distinct from an airship , which is a powered aerostat that can propel itself through the air in a controlled manner. Ballute  a portmanteau of balloon and parachute  is a parachute-like braking device optimized for use at high altitudes and supersonic velocities. Invented by Goodyear in 1958, the original ballute was a cone-shaped balloon with a toroidal burble fence fitted around its widest point. A burble fence is an inflated structure intended to ensure flow separation . 25  This stabilizes the ballute as it decelerates through different flow regimes from supersonic to subsonic. Beam-powered propulsion  also known as directed energy propulsion, is a class of aircraft or spacecraft propulsion that uses energy beamed to the spacecraft from a remote power plant to provide energy. The beam is typically either a microwave or a laser beam and it is either pulsed or continuous. A continuous beam lends itself to thermal rockets , photonic thrusters and light sails , whereas a pulsed beam lends itself to ablative thrusters and pulse detonation engines . 26  Bearing  In navigation , bearing is the horizontal angle between the direction of an object and another object, or between it and that of true north. Absolute bearing refers to the angle between the magnetic North magnetic bearing or true North true bearing and an object. For example, an object to the East would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees. Relative bearing refers to the angle between the crafts forward direction, and the location of another object. For example, an object relative bearing of 0 degrees would be dead ahead an object relative bearing 180 degrees would be behind. 27  Bearings can be measured in mils or degrees. Bernoullis principle  In fluid dynamics , Bernoullis principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or a decrease in the fluid s potential energy . 28   Ch.3  29    3.5  Bi-elliptic transfer  is an orbital maneuver that moves a spacecraft from one orbit to another and may, in certain situations, require less delta-v than a Hohmann transfer maneuver. The bi-elliptic transfer consists of two half- elliptic orbits . From the initial orbit, a first burn expends delta-v to boost the spacecraft into the first transfer orbit with an apoapsis at some point r b displaystyle r_b away from the central body . At this point a second burn sends the spacecraft into the second elliptical orbit with periapsis at the radius of the final desired orbit, where a third burn is performed, injecting the spacecraft into the desired orbit. 30  Big dumb booster  BDB, is a general class of launch vehicle based on the premise that it is cheaper to operate large rockets of simple design than it is to operate smaller, more complex ones regardless of the lower payload efficiency. 31  Bleed air  produced by gas turbine engines is compressed air that is taken from the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. Booster  A booster rocket or engine is either the first stage of a multistage launch vehicle , or else a shorter-burning rocket used in parallel with longer-burning sustainer rockets to augment the space vehicle s takeoff thrust and payload capability. 32  33  Boundary layer  In physics and fluid mechanics , a boundary layer is an important concept and refers to the layer of fluid in the immediate vicinity of a bounding surface where the effects of viscosity are significant. In the Earths atmosphere , the atmospheric boundary layer is the air layer near the ground affected by diurnal heat, moisture or momentum transfer to or from the surface. On an aircraft wing the boundary layer is the part of the flow close to the wing, where viscous forces distort the surrounding non-viscous flow. Buoyancy  In physics , buoyancy or upthrust , is an upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus the pressure at the bottom of a column of fluid is greater than at the top of the column. Similarly, the pressure at the bottom of an object submerged in a fluid is greater than at the top of the object. This pressure difference results in a net upw ards force on the object. The magnitude of that force exerted is proportional to that pressure difference, and as explained by Archimedes principle  is equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the volume of the object, i.e. the displaced fluid. C  edit  Cabin pressurization  is a process in which conditioned air is pumped into the cabin of an aircraft or spacecraft , in order to create a safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually bled off from the gas turbine engines at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often cryogenic tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more environmental control systems . 34  The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve. Cable lacing  is a method for tying wiring harnesses and cable looms, traditionally used in telecommunication , naval, and aerospace applications. This old cable management technique, taught to generations of linemen , 35  is still used in some modern applications since it does not create obstructions along the length of the cable, avoiding the handling problems of cables groomed by plastic or hook-and-loop cable ties . Canard  is an aeronautical arrangement wherein a small forewing or foreplane is placed forward of the main wing of a fixed-wing aircraft . The term canard may be used to describe the aircraft itself, the wing configuration or the foreplane. 36  37  38  Centennial challenges  Center of gravity  A bodys center of gravity is the point around which the resultant torque due to gravity forces vanishes. Where a gravity field can be considered to be uniform, the mass-center and the center-of-gravity will be the same. However, for satellites in orbit around a planet, in the absence of other torques being applied to a satellite, the slight variation gradient in gravitational field between closer-to stronger and further-from weaker the plane t can lead to a torque that will tend to align the satellite such that its long axis is vertical. In such a case, it is important to make the distinction between the center-of-gravity and the mass-center. Any horizontal offset between the two will result in an applied torque. Center of mass  In physics , the center of mass of a distribution of mass in space is the unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero, or the point where if a force is applied it moves in the direction of the force without rotating. The distribution of mass is balanced around the center of mass and the average of the weighted position coordinates of the distributed mass defines its coordinates. Center of pressure  is the point where the total sum of a pressure field acts on a body, causing a force to act through that point. Chord  is the imaginary straight line joining the leading and trailing edges of an aerofoil . The chord length is the distance between the trailing edge and the point on the leading edge where the chord intersects the leading edge . 39  40  Clean configuration  is the flight configuration of a fixed-wing aircraft when its external equipment is retracted to minimize drag and thus maximize airspeed for a given power setting. Cockpit  or flight deck , is the area, usually near the front of an aircraft or spacecraft , from which a pilot controls the aircraft. Collimated beam  A collimated beam of light or other electromagnetic radiation has parallel rays , and therefore will spread minimally as it propagates. A perfectly collimated light beam , with no divergence , would not disperse with distance. Such a beam cannot be created, due to diffraction . 41  Comet  is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun , warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing . This produces a visible atmosphere or coma , and sometimes also a tail . Compression  In mechanics , compression is the application of balanced inward pushing forces to different points on a material or structure, that is, forces with no net sum or torque directed so as to reduce its size in one or more directions. 42  It is contrasted with tension or traction, the application of balanced outward pulling forces and with shearing forces, directed so as to displace layers of the material parallel to each other. The compressive strength of materials and structures is an important engineering consideration. Compressibility  In thermodynamics and fluid mechanics , compressibility also known as the coefficient of compressibility 43  or isothermal compressibility 44   is a measure of the relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response to a pressure or mean stress  change. In its simple form, the compressibility  displaystyle beta  may be expressed as    1 V  V  p displaystyle beta -frac 1Vfrac partial Vpartial p , where V is volume and p is pressure. The choice to define compressibility as the opposite of the fraction makes compressibility positive in the usual case that an increase in pressure induces a reduction in volume. t is also known as reciprocal of bulk modulusk of elasticity of a fluid. Computational fluid dynamics   CFD , is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows . Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid  liquids and gases  with surfaces defined by boundary conditions . With high-speed supercomputers , better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Constant speed drive   CSD , is a type of transmission that takes an input shaft rotating at a wide range of speeds, delivering this power to an output shaft that rotates at a constant speed, despite the varying input. They are used to drive mechanisms, typically electrical generators , that require a constant input speed. The term is most commonly applied to hydraulic transmissions found on the accessory drives of gas turbine engines, such as aircraft jet engines . On modern aircraft, the CSD is often combined with a generator into a single unit known as an integrated drive generator  IDG . Control engineering  or control systems engineering , is an engineering discipline that applies automatic control theory to design systems with desired behaviors in control environments. 45  The discipline of controls overlaps and is usually taught along with electrical engineering at many institutions around the world. 45  Conservation of momentum  Controllability  Crew Exploration Vehicle  Critical mach  In aerodynamics , the critical Mach number Mcr or M  of an aircraft is the lowest Mach number at which the airflow over some point of the aircraft reaches the speed of sound , but does not exceed it. 46  At the lower critical Mach number , airflow around the entire aircraft is subsonic. At the upper critical Mach number , airflow around the entire aircraft is supersonic. 47  Centrifugal compressor  Centrifugal compressors , sometimes called radial compressors , are a sub-class of dynamic axisymmetric work-absorbing turbomachinery . 48  They achieve a pressure rise by adding kinetic energy  velocity to a continuous flow of fluid through the rotor or impeller . This kinetic energy is then converted to an increase in potential energy static pressure by slowing the flow through a diffuser. The pressure rise in the impeller is in most cases almost equal to the rise in the diffuser. Constant speed drive   CSD , is a type of transmission that takes an input shaft rotating at a wide range of speeds, delivering this power to an output shaft that rotates at a constant speed, despite the varying input. They are used to drive mechanisms, typically electrical generators , that require a constant input speed. The term is most commonly applied to hydraulic transmissions found on the accessory drives of gas turbine engines, such as aircraft jet engines . On modern aircraft, the CSD is often combined with a generator into a single unit known as an integrated drive generator  IDG . Corrected flow  Corrected speed  Cylinder stress  In mechanics , a cylinder stress is a stress distribution with rotational symmetry  that is, which remains unchanged if the stressed object is rotated about some fixed axis. D  edit  Damage tolerance  is a property of a structure relating to its ability to sustain defects safely until repair can be effected. The approach to engineering design to account for damage tolerance is based on the assumption that flaws can exist in any structure and such flaws propagate with usage. Decalage  Decalage on a fixed-wing aircraft is the angle difference between the upper and lower wings of a biplane , i.e. the acute angle contained between the chords of the wings in question. Decalage is said to be positive when the upper wing has a higher angle of incidence than the lower wing, and negative when the lower wings incidence is greater than that of the upper wing. Positive decalage results in greater lift from the upper wing than the lower wing, the difference increasing with the amount of decalage. 49  De Laval nozzle  or convergent-divergent nozzle , CD nozzle or con-di nozzle , is a tube that is pinched in the middle, making a carefully balanced, asymmetric hourglass shape. It is used to accelerate a hot, pressurized gas passing through it to a higher supersonic speed in the axial thrust direction, by converting the heat energy of the flow into kinetic energy . Because of this, the nozzle is widely used in some types of steam turbines and rocket engine nozzles . It also sees use in supersonic jet engines . Dead reckoning  In navigation , dead reckoning is the process of calculating ones current position by using a previously determined position, or fix , and advancing that position based upon known or estimated speeds over elapsed time and course. Deflection  is the degree to which a structural element is displaced under a load . It may refer to an angle or a distance. Deformation engineering  In materials science , deformation refers to any changes in the shape or size of an object due to an applied force the deformation energy, in this case, is transferred through work or a change in temperature the deformation energy, in this case, is transferred through heat. Deformation mechanics  in continuum mechanics is the transformation of a body from a reference configuration to a current configuration. 50  A configuration is a set containing the positions of all particles of the body. A deformation may be caused by external loads , 51  body forces such as gravity or electromagnetic forces , or changes in temperature, moisture content, or chemical reactions, etc. Delta-v  literally  change in velocity , symbolised as  v and pronounced delta-vee , as used in spacecraft flight dynamics , is a measure of the impulse that is needed to perform a maneuver such as launch from, or landing on a planet or moon, or in-space orbital maneuver . It is a scalar that has the units of speed . As used in this context, it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle. Delta-v budget  is an estimate of the total delta- v required for a space mission . It is calculated as the sum of the delta-v required for the propulsive maneuvers during the mission, and as input to the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation , determines how much propellant is required for a vehicle of given mass and propulsion system. Delta wing  is a wing shaped in the form of a triangle. It is named for its similarity in shape to the Greek uppercase letter delta . Although long studied, it did not find significant applications until the jet age , when it proved suitable for high-speed subsonic and supersonic flight. Density  Departure resistance  is a quality of an aircraft which enables it to remain in controlled flight and resist entering potentially dangerous less-controlled maneuvers such as spin . Derivative  The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value output value with respect to a change in its argument input value. Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus . For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the objects velocity  this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances. Digital Datcom  The United States Air Force Stability and Control Digital DATCOM is a computer program that implements the methods contained in the USAF Stability and Control DATCOM to calculate the static stability, control and dynamic derivative characteristics of fixed-wing aircraft . Digital DATCOM requires an input file containing a geometric description of an aircraft, and outputs its corresponding dimensionless stability derivatives according to the specified flight conditions. The values obtained can be used to calculate meaningful aspects of flight dynamics . Dihedral  Dihedral angle is the upward angle from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of a fixed-wing aircraft . Anhedral angle is the name given to negative dihedral angle, that is, when there is a downward angle from horizontal of the wings or tailplane of a fixed-wing aircraft. Disk loading  In fluid dynamics , disk loading or disc loading is the average pressure change across an actuator disk , such as an airscrew. Airscrews with a relatively low disk loading are typically called rotors, including helicopter main rotors and tail rotors  propellers typically have a higher disk loading. 52  Displacement vector  Distance measuring equipment  DME, is a radio navigation technology that measures the slant range distance between an aircraft and a ground station by timing the propagation delay of radio signals in the frequency band between 960 and 1215 megahertz MHz. Line-of-visibility between the aircraft and ground station is required. An interrogator airborne initiates an exchange by transmitting a pulse pair, on an assigned channel, to the transponder ground station. The channel assignment specifies the carrier frequency and the spacing between the puls es. After a known delay, the transponder replies by transmitting a pulse pair on a frequency that is offset from the interrogation frequency by 63 MHz and having specified separation 53  . DME  distance measuring equipment. DO-178B  DO-254  Drag physics  In fluid dynamics , drag sometimes called air resistance, a type of friction , or fluid resistance, another type of friction or fluid friction is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving with respect to a surrounding fluid. 54  This can exist between two fluid layers or surfaces or a fluid and a solid surface. Unlike other resistive forces, such as dry friction , which are nearly independent of velocity, drag forces depend on velocity. 55  56  Drag force is proportional to the velocity for a laminar flow and the squared velocity for a turbulent flow . Even though the ultimate cause of a drag is viscous friction, the turbulent drag is independent of viscosity . 57  Drag forces always decrease fluid velocity relative to the solid object in the fluids path . Drag coefficient  In fluid dynamics , the drag coefficient commonly denoted as C d displaystyle scriptstyle C_mathrm d , , C x displaystyle scriptstyle C_mathrm x , or C w displaystyle scriptstyle C_mathrm w ,  is a dimensionless quantity that is used to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water. It is used in the drag equation in which a lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have less aerodynamic or hydrodynamic drag. The drag coefficient is always associated with a particular surface area. 58  Drag equation  In fluid dynamics , the drag equation is a formula used to calculate the force of drag experienced by an object due to movement through a fully enclosing fluid . The equation is F D  1 2  u 2 C D A displaystyle F_D,,tfrac 12,rho ,u2,C_D,A F D displaystyle F_D is the drag force , which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity,  displaystyle rho  is the mass density of the fluid, 59  u displaystyle u is the flow velocity relative to the object, A displaystyle A is the reference area , and C D displaystyle C_D is the drag coefficient  a dimensionless coefficient related to the objects geometry and taking into account both skin friction and form drag . In general, C D displaystyle C_D depends on the Reynolds number . Drop test  is a method of testing the in-flight characteristics of prototype or experimental aircraft and spacecraft by raising the test vehicle to a specific altitude and then releasing it. Test flights involving powered aircraft, particularly rocket-powered aircraft , may be referred to as drop launches due to the launch of the aircrafts rockets after release from its carrier aircraft. Dual mode propulsion rocket  Dual mode propulsion systems combine the high efficiency of bipropellant rockets with the reliability and simplicity of monopropellant rockets . It is based upon the use of two rocket fuels , liquid hydrogen and more dense hydrocarbon fuels, like RP, which are all burned with liquid oxygen . 60  Ductility  is a measure of a materials ability to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture, which may be expressed as percent elongation or percent area reduction from a tensile test. E  edit  Earths atmosphere  The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases , commonly known as air , that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earths gravity . The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earths surface , absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation , warming the surface through heat retention  greenhouse effect , and reducing temperature extremes between day and night the diurnal temperature variation .
