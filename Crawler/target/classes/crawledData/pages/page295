This is useful to disambiguate different items with similar or identical headings, as well as establish a single standard title for an item that is commonly known by two or more titles. When used, authority control data links can be found near the bottom of Wikipedia pages, linking to bibliographical recor ds on worldwide library catalogs . Authority control is often used on biographical articles because it is quite common for more than one person to share the same name. It is commonly used in other subject material, as well. Authority control enables researchers to search more easily for pertinent information on the subject of an article, without needing to disambiguate the subject manually. For example, authority control is used on music articles so that the information in the article can be easily cross-referenced with the popular MusicBrainz database. This enables many media applications to display information about an artist from the relevant Wikipedia article when one of their songs is played. More generally, authority control is a method of creating and maintaining index terms for bibliographical material in a library catalogue. The links produced by the authority control template on Wikipedia go to authority control data in worldwide library catalogues. As an example, the Wikipedia authority control information for Alexander Graham Bell looks like this Authority control GND  119408643 ISNI  0000 0000 8138 6064 LCCN  n79113947 VIAF  59263727 WorldCat Identities via VIAF 59263727 WorldCat is a global cooperative union catalog which itemizes the collections of 72,000 libraries in 170 countries and territories.
