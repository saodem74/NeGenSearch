ACM Computing Classification System From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The ACM Computing Classification System  CCS  is a subject classification system for computing devised by the Association for Computing Machinery ACM. The system is comparable to the Mathematics Subject Classification MSC in scope, aims, and structure, being used by the various ACM journals to organise subjects by area. Contents 1 History 2 Structure 3 See also 4 References 5 External links History  edit  The system has gone through seven revisions, the first version being published in 1964, and revised versions appearing in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991, 1998, and the now current version in 2012. Structure  edit  The ACM Computing Classification System, version 2012, has a revolutionary change in some areas, for example, in Software that now is called Software and its engineering which has three main subjects Software organization and properties. This subject addresses properties of the software itself. Software notations and tools. This subject covers programming languages and other tools for writing programs. Software creation and management. This subject covers human activities including software management. It is hierarchically structured in four levels. Thus, for example, one branch of the hierarchy contains Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence Knowledge representation and reasoning Ontology engineering v t e ACM Computing Classification System The 2012 version of the ACM classification has the following main categories. General and reference Document types  Cross-computing tools and techniques Hardware Printed circuit boards  Communication hardware, interfaces and storage  Integrated circuits  Very large scale integration design  Power and energy  Electronic design automation  Hardware validation  Hardware test  Robustness  Emerging technologies Computer systems organization Architectures  Embedded and cyber-physical systems  Real-time systems  Dependable and fault-tolerant systems and networks Networks Network architectures  Network protocols  Network components  Network algorithms  Network performance evaluation  Network properties  Network services  Network types Software and its engineering Software organization and properties  Software notations and tools  Software creation and management Theory of computation Models of computation  Formal languages and automata theory  Computational complexity and cryptography  Logic  Design and analysis of algorithms  Randomness, geometry and discrete structures  Theory and algorithms for application domains  Semantics and reasoning Mathematics of computing Discrete mathematics  Probability and statistics  Mathematical software  Information theory  Mathematical analysis  Continuous mathematics Information systems Data management systems  Information storage systems  Information systems applications  World Wide Web  Information retrieval Security and privacy Cryptography  Formal methods and theory of security  Security services  Intrusionanomaly detection and malware mitigation  Security in hardware  Systems security  Network security  Database and storage security  Software and application security  Human and societal aspects of security and privacy Human-centered computing Humancomputer interaction  Interaction design  Collaborative and social computing  Ubiquitous and mobile computing  Visualization  Accessibility Computing methodologies Symbolic and algebraic manipulation  Parallel computing methodologies  Artificial intelligence  Machine learning  Modeling and simulation  Computer graphics  Distributed computing methodologies  Concurrent computing methodologies Applied computing Electronic commerce  Enterprise computing  Physical sciences and engineering  Life and medical sciences  Law, social and behavioral sciences  Computer forensics  Arts and humanities  Computers in other domains  Operations research  Education  Document management and text processing Social and professional topics Professional topics  Computingtechnology policy  User characteristics Proper nouns people, technologies and companies Companies  Organizations  People in computing  Technologies v t e Computer science Note This template roughly follows the 2012 ACM Computing Classification System .

The ACM Computing Research Repository uses a classification scheme that is much coarser than the ACM subject classification, and does not cover all areas of CS, but is intended to better cover active areas of research. In addition, papers in this repository are classified according to the ACM subject classification. This computer science article is a stub .
