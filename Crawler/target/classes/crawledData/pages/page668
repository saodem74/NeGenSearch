Illusion From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Distortion of the perception of reality This article is about perception. For figures of speech, see Allusion . For other uses, see Illusion disambiguation . The transparent dial in this  mystery watch  may create the illusion in the viewer that the hands work without any movement. An illusion is a distortion of the senses , which can reveal how the human brain normally organizes and interprets sensory stimulation . Though illusions distort our perception of reality, they are generally shared by most people. 1  Illusions may occur with any of the human senses, but visual illusions  optical illusions  are the best-known and understood. The emphasis on visual illusions occurs because vision often dominates the other senses. For example, individuals watching a ventriloquist will perceive the voice is coming from the dummy since they are able to see the dummy mouth the words. 2  Some illusions are based on general assumptions the brain makes during perception . These assumptions are made using organizational principles e.g., Gestalt theory, an individuals capacity for depth perception and motion perception, and perceptual constancy . Other illusions occur because of biological sensory structures within the human body or conditions outside the body within ones physical environment. The term illusion refers to a specific form of sensory distortion. Unlike a hallucination , which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus , an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water or another auditory source would be an illusion.

Main article Optical illusion An optical illusion is characterized by visually perceived images that are deceptive or misleading. Therefore, the information gathered by the eye is processed by the brain to give, on the face of it, a percept that does not tally with a physical measurement of the stimulus source. A conventional assumption is that there are physiological illusions that occur naturally and cognitive illusions that can be demonstrated by specific visual tricks that say something more basic about how human perceptual systems work. The human brain constructs a world inside our head based on what it samp les from the surrounding environment. However, sometimes it tries to organize this information it thinks best while other times it fills in the gaps. 3  4  This way in which our brain works is the basis of an illusion. Auditory  edit  Main article Auditory illusion An auditory illusion is an illusion of hearing , the auditory equivalent of an optical illusion the listener hears either sound which are not present in the stimulus, or impossible sounds. In short, audio illusions highlight areas where the human ear and brain, as organic, makeshift tools, differ from perfect audio receptors for better or for worse. One example of an auditory illusion is a Shepard tone . Tactile  edit  Main article Tactile illusion Examples of tactile illusions include phantom limb , the thermal grill illusion , the cutaneous rabbit illusion and a curious illusion that occurs when the crossed index and middle fingers are run along the bridge of the nose with one finger on each side, resulting in the perception of two separate noses. The brain areas activated during illusory tactile perception are similar to those activated during actual tactile stimulation. 5  Tactile illusions can also be elicited through haptic technology. 6  These illusory tactile objects can be used to create virtual objects. 7  Temporal  edit  Main article Time perception  Types of temporal illusions A temporal illusion is a distortion in the perception of time, which occurs when the time interval between two or more events is very narrow typically less than a second. In such cases, a person may momentarily perceive time as slowing down, stopping, speeding up, or running backward. Other senses  edit  Illusions can occur with the other senses including those involved in food perception. Both sound 8  and touch 9  have been shown to modulate the perceived staleness and crispness of food products. It was also discovered that even if some portion of the taste receptor on the tongue became damaged that illusory taste could be produced by tactile stimulation. 10  Evidence of olfactory smell illusions occurred when positive or negative verbal labels were given prior to olfactory stimulation. 11  The McGurk effect shows that what we hear is influenced by what we see as we hear the person speaking. An illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. This is a multisensory, auditory-visual illusion. 12  Disorders  edit  Some illusions occur as a result of an illness or a disorder. While these types of illusions are not shared with everyone, they are typical of each condition. For example, migraine sufferers often report fortification illusions . Neuroscience  edit  Perception is linked to specific brain activity and so can be elicited by brain stimulation. The illusory percepts that can be evoked range from simple phosphenes detections of lights in the visual field  to high-level percepts. In a single-case study on a patient undergoing presurgical evaluation for epilepsy treatment, electrical stimulation at the left temporo-parietal junction evoked the percept of a nearby illusory person who closely shadowed changes in the patients body position and posture. 13  14  See also  edit  Altered state of consciousness Aporia Argument from illusion Augmented reality    View of the real world with computer-generated supplementary features Cognitive dissonance    Mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time Delusion Dream argument Holography Illusion costume List of cognitive biases Moon illusion Paradox    Statement that apparently contradicts itself Pareidolia    Perception of meaningful patterns or images in random or vague stimuli Simulated reality References  edit   Solso, R.
