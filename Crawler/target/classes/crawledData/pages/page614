For example, publication dates within a single article might be in one, but only one, of these formats among others Jones, J. 20 September 2008 Jones, J. September 20, 2008 Access and archive dates in an articles citations should all use the same format, which may be the format used for publication dates in the article the format expected in the citation style adopted in the article e.g. 20 Sep 2008  or yyyy - mm - dd For example, accessarchive dates within a single article might be in one, but only one, of these formats among others Jones, J.

When a citation style does not expect differing date formats, it is permissible to normalize publication dates to the article body text date format, andor accessarchive dates to either, with date consistency being preferred. Strong national ties to a topic  edit  Shortcuts MOSDATETIES WPMILFORMAT For any given article, the choice of date format and the choice of national variety of English see WPManual of StyleStrong national ties to a topic  are independent issues. Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the date format most commonly used in that nation. For the United States this is for example July 4, 1976  for most other English-speaking countries it is 4 July 1976 . Articles related to Canada or Israel may use either format with as always consistency within each article. see Retaining existing format In some topic areas, the customary format differs from the usual national one for example, articles on the modern US military, including US military biographical articles, use day-before-month, in accordance with US military usage. Retaining existing format  edit  Shortcuts MOSDATERET MOSDATEVAR See also WikipediaManual of Style   Retaining the existing variety If an article has evolved using predominantly one date format, this format should be used throughout the article, unless there are reasons for changing it based on strong national ties to the topic or consensus on the articles talk page. The date format chosen in the first major contribution in the early stages of an article i.e., the first non-stub version should continue to be used, unless there is reason to change it based on strong national ties to the topic or consensus on the articles talk page. Where an article has shown no clear sign of which format is used, the first person to insert a date is equivalent to the first major contributor. Era style  edit  Shortcuts MOSERA MOSBCE The default calendar eras are the Anno Domini and Common Era respectively, BC and AD and BCE and CE . Either convention may be appropriate for use in Wikipedia articles depending on the article context. Apply WikipediaManual of Style   Retaining existing styles with regard to changes from one era to the other. Use either the BCAD or the BCECE notation consistently within the same article. Exception do not change direct quotations , titles, etc. Do not change the established era style in an article unless there are reasons specific to its content. Seek consensus on the talk page first, applying WikipediaManual of Style   Retaining existing styles . Open the discussion under a subhead that uses the word era. Briefly state why the style is inappropriate for the article in question. BCE and CE or BC and AD are written in upper case, unspaced, without a full stop period, . , and separated from the numeric year by a space  5   BC , not 5BC . It is advisable to use a non-breaking space . AD may appear before or after a year  AD   106 , 106   AD  the other abbreviations appear only after  106   CE , 3700   BCE , 3700   BC . In general, do not use CE or AD unless required to avoid ambiguity e.g. The Norman Conquest took place in 1066 not 1066   CE nor AD   1066  or awkwardness  January 1, 1 AD not January 1, 1 . On the other hand, Plotinus lived at the end of the 3rd century AD will avoid confusion, and depending on context one- and two-digit years may look more natural with an era marker  born in 2   AD . Also, in He did not become king until 55   CE the era marker makes it clear that 55 does not refer to the new kings age or write He did not become king until the year 55 . If the era is shown for the initial date in a range, then use it for the final date as well not from 450 BCE to 200 but from 450 to 200 BCE or from 450 BCE to 200 BCE and definitely from 100 BCE to 200 CE . see Ranges Uncalibrated bce radiocarbon dates Calibrated and uncalibrated dates can diverge widely, and some sources distinguish the two only via BCE or BC for calibrated dates versus bce , bc or b.c. uncalibrated. Avoid giving uncalibrated dates except in direct quotations, and even then a footnote or square-bracketed note like this should note that the date is uncalibrated or ideally give the calibrated date. BP or YBP  In scientific and academic contexts, BP before present or YBP years before present are often used.  Present in this context conventionally refers to January   1, 1950. Write 3000 years   BP or 3000   YBP or 3000   years before present but not forms such as 3000 before present and 3000 years before the present . If one of the abbreviated forms is used, link to Before present on first use The Jones artifact was dated to 4000   YBP , the Smith artifact to 5000 YBP. Other era systems may be appropriate in an article. In such cases, dates should be followed by a conversion to Anno Domini or Common Era and the first instance should be linked Qasr-al-Khalifa was built in 221   AH 836   CE , or in 836   AD 221   AH  . Astronomical year numbering follows the Common Era and does not require conversion, but the first instance of a non-positive year should still be linked The March equinox passed into Pisces in year   67 . Julian and Gregorian calendars  edit  Shortcuts MOSOSNS MOSJG See also Old Style and New Style dates A date can be given in any appropriate calendar, as long as it is at the minimum given in the Julian calendar or the Gregorian calendar or both, as described below. For example, an article on the early history of Islam may give dates in both Islamic and Julian calendars. Where a calendar other than the Julian or Gregorian is used, the article must make this clear. Current events are dated using the Gregorian calendar. Dates of events in countries using the Gregorian calendar at that time are given in the Gregorian calendar. This includes some of the Continent of Europe from 1582 , the British Empire from 14   September 1752, and Russia from 14   February 1918 see Adoption of the Gregorian calendar  . Dates before 15   October 1582 when the Gregorian calendar was first adopted in some places are normally given in the Julian calendar. The Julian day and month should not be converted to the Gregorian calendar, but the start of the Julian year should be assumed to be 1   January see below for more details . Dates for Roman history before 45   BC are given in the Roman calendar , which was neither Julian nor Gregorian. When rarely the Julian equivalent is certain, it may be included. For dates in early Egyptian and Mesopotamian history, Julian or Gregorian equivalents are often uncertain. Follow the consensus of reliable sources, or indicate their divergence. The dating method used should follow that used by reliable secondary sources or if reliable sources disagree, that used most commonly, with an explanatory footnote . Where its not obvious that a given date should be given in Julian alone or in Gregorian alone, consider giving both styles, for example by using   OldStyleDate  . If a date appears without being specified as Old Style or New Style, tagging that date with   which calendar   will the page to CategoryArticles containing ambiguous dates for further attention. If there is a need to mention Old or New Style dates in an article as in the Glorious Revolution , a footnote should be provided on the first usage, stating whether the New Style refers to a start of year adjustment or to the Gregorian calendar it can mean either. At some places and times, the new year began on a date other than 1   January. For example, in England and its colonies until 1752, the year began on Annunciation Day , 25   March see the New Year article for other styles . In writing about historical events, however, years should be assumed to have begun on 1   January see the example of the execution of Charles I in  Differences in the start of the year   if there is reason to use another start-of-year date, this should be noted. Ranges  edit  Shortcuts MOSDOB MOSOTHERDATE MOSDATERANGE A simple yearyear range is written using an en dash  ndash or  ndash   not an em dash, hyphen or slash this dash is unspaced that is, with no space on either side and the ranges end year is usually given in full 18811886    18811992 not 188186    1881    1992  Markup 1881   ndash  1886 or 1881 ndash1886 Two-digit ending years  188182 , but never 1881882 or 18812  may be used in any of the following cases 1 two consecutive years 2 infoboxes and tables where space is limited using a single format consistently in any given table column and 3 in certain topic areas if there is a very good reason, such as matching the established convention of reliable sources. g  The slash notation  20052006  may be used to signify a fiscal year or other special period, if that convention is used in reliable sources.

In all cases, colons separate hours, minutes, and where present seconds, e.g. 13809   pm or 133809 . Use figures  11   a.m. or 1245   p.m.  rather than words  twelve forty-five p.m. . 12-hour clock times end with lower-case a.m. or p.m. , or am or pm , preceded by a non-breaking space , e.g. 230   p.m. or 230   pm markup 230   nbsp  p.m. or 230   nbsp  pm , not 230p.m. or 230pm . Hours should not have a leading zero e.g. 230   p.m. , not 0230   p.m. . Usually, use noon and midnight rather than 12 pm and 12 am  whether midnight refers to the start or the end of a date should be explicitly specified unless clear from the context. Where several times that are all a.m. or all p.m. appear in close proximity, then a.m. or p.m. need be given only once if there is no risk of confusion. 24-hour clock times have no a.m., p.m., noon or midnight suffix, and include a colon  1530 not 1530 . Hours under 10 should have a leading zero  0815 . The time 0000 refers to midnight at the start of a date, 1200 to noon, and 2400 to midnight at the end of a date, but 24 should not be used for the first hour of the next day e.g. use 0010 for ten minutes after midnight, not 2410 . Time zones Shortcut MOSTIMEZONE Give dates and times appropriate to the time zone where an event took place. For example, the date of the attack on Pearl Harbor should be December   7, 1941 Hawaii time date. Give priority to the place at which the event had its most significant effects for example, if a hacker in Monaco attacked a Pentagon computer in the US, use the time zone for the Pentagon, where the attack had its effect. In some cases, the best solution may be to add the date and time in Coordinated Universal Time UTC. For example       8   p.m. Eastern Standard Time on January   15, 2001 0100   UTC, January   16 Alternatively, include just the UTC offset        2100   British Summer Time  UTC1  on 27   July 2012 Rarely, the time zone in which an event took place has since changed for example, China to 1949 was divided into five time zones , whereas all of modern China is UTC8 . Similarly, the term UTC is not appropriate for dates before this system was adopted in 1960 1  Universal Time UT is the appropriate term for the mean time at the prime meridian Greenwich when it is unnecessary to specify the precise definition of the time scale. Be sure to show the UTC or offset appropriate to the clock time in use at the time of the event, not the modern time zone, if they differ. Days of the week  edit  Days of the week are capitalized  Sunday , Wednesday . Where space is limited tables, infoboxes, etc. an en dash may be used for a range  MondayThursday . Seasons of the year  edit  Shortcut MOSSEASON Seasons are uncapitalized  a hot summer  except when personified Old Man Winters bleak greys relent as Spring begins to show her colors . Avoid the use of seasons to refer to a particular time of year  winter 1995  as such uses are ambiguous the seasons are six months apart in the northern and southern hemispheres, and areas near the equator have only wet and dry seasons . Unambiguous alternatives include early 1995    the first quarter of 1995    January to March 1995    spent the southern summer in Antarctica . Referring to a season by name is appropriate when it is part of a formal or conventional name or designation  annual mid-winter festival    the autumn harvest    2018 Winter Olympics    Times Fall Books Supplement    Details appeared in Quarterly Review , Summer  2015    The Courts winter term . Decades  edit  Shortcut MOSDECADE To refer to a decade as a chronological period per se not with reference to a social era or cultural phenomenon, always use four digits as in the   1980s . Do not use the   1980s , the   1980 ies , or the   1980s unless a possessive is actually meant. Prefixes should be hyphenated  the   mid 1980s    pre 1960s social attitudes . For a social era or cultural phenomenon associated with a particular decade Two digits with a preceding apostrophe may be used as an alternative to four digits, but only if this is a well-established phrase seen in reliable sources  the   Roaring   20s ,   the   Gay   90s ,   condemning the 60s counterculture , but grew up in 1960s Boston, moving to Dallas in   1971 , and do not write the   90s    the   90s    or the   90s .

Centuries and millennia are identified using either Arabic numerals  the 18th century  or words  the second millennium . When used adjectivally they contain a hyphen  nineteenth-century painting or 19th-century painting . Do not use superscripts  19 th century . Do not capitalize  the best Nineteenth-century paintings    during the Nineteenth Century  Do not use Roman numerals  XVIII   century . The 18th century refers to the period  17011800 , while strictly the 1700s refers either to  17001799  or  17001709  When using forms such as the 1900s , ensure that there is no ambiguity as to whether the century or just its first decade is meant.

Numbers  edit  Numbers as figures or words  edit  Shortcuts MOSNUMERAL MOSSPELL09 Information on specific situations is scattered elsewhere on this page. Generally, in article text Integers from zero to nine are spelled out in words. Integers greater than nine expressible in one or two words may be expressed either in numerals or in words  16 or sixteen , 84 or eighty-four , 200 or two hundred . When written as words, numbers from 21 to 99 are hyphenated including when part of a larger number fifty-six or fifty-six thousand but five   hundred or five   thousand . Other numbers are given in numerals  3.75 , 544  or in forms such as 21   million . Markup 21nbspmillion Billion and trillion are understood to represent their short-scale values of 10 9   1,000,000,000 and 10 12   1,000,000,000,000, respectively. Keep this in mind when translating articles from non-English or older sources. M unspaced, capitalized or bn unspaced, respectively, may be used for million or billion after a number, when the word has been spelled out at the first occurrence  She received 70   million and her son 10M . SI prefixes and symbols, such as mega-    M , giga-    G  and tera-    T , should be used only with units of measure as appropriate to the field, and not to express large quantities in other contexts. Examples of misuse In a population of 1.3G   people, 300   megadeaths would be expected. Sometimes, the variety of English used in an article may suggest the use of a numbering system other than the Western thousands-based system. For example, the South Asian numbering system is conventionally used for certain things especially monetary amounts in South Asian English . This is discouraged in Wikipedia articles by WPManual of Style   Opportunities for commonality . When it is done anyway, for contextually important reasons, link the first spelled-out instance of each quantity e.g. crore , which yields crore . If no instances are spelled out, provide a note after the first instance, directing the reader to the article about the numbering system. Provide a conversion to Western numbers for the first instance of each quantity the templates  lakh  ,  crore  , and  lakh crore  may be used for this purpose, and provide conversions for subsequent instances if they do not overwhelm the content of the article. For example, write three crore thirty million . When converting a currency amount, use the exchange rate that applied at the time being written about the  INRConvert  template can be used for this purpose. Group digits in Western thousands-based style e.g., 30,000,000  not 3,00,00,000  see   Delimiting grouping of digits , below . The variety of English does not uniquely determine the method of numbering in an article. Other considerations   such as conventions used in mathematics, science, and engineering   may also apply. The choice and order of formats and conversions is a matter of editorial discretion and consensus at the article.

For the Microsoft Research project, see Project Digits . Shortcuts WPDIGITS MOSDIGITS Digits should be grouped and separated either by commas or by narrow gaps  never a periodfull point. Grouping with commas Left of the decimal point, five or more digits are grouped into threes separated by commas e.g. 12,200  255,200  km  8,274,527th   1  86,400 . Numbers with exactly four digits left of the decimal point may optionally be grouped either 1,250 or 1250 , provided that this is consistent within each article. When commas are used left of the decimal point, digits right of the decimal point are not grouped i.e. should be given as an unbroken string. Markup   formatnum   produces this formatting. Grouping with narrow gaps Digits are grouped both sides of the decimal point e.g. 6 543 210 .123 456  520.012 34  C  101 325  760 . Digits are generally grouped into threes. Right of the decimal point, usual practice is to have a final group of four in preference to leaving an orphaned digit at the end  99.123 4567 , but 99.123 456 7 would also be acceptable. In mathematics-oriented articles long strings may be grouped into fives e.g. 3.14159 26535 89793 23846 ... . This style is especially recommended for articles related to science, technology, engineering or mathematics. Markup Templates  val  or  gaps  may be used to produce this formatting. Note that use of any space character as a separator in numbers, including non-breaking space, is problematic for screen readers . See   Non-breaking spaces . Screen readers read out each group of digits as separate numbers e.g. 30 thinsp000 is read as thirty zero zero zero. Delimiting style should be consistent throughout a given article. Either use commas or narrow gaps, but not both in the same article. Either group the thousands in a four-digit number or do not, but not mixed use in the same article. However, grouping by threes and fives may coexist. An exception is made for four-digit page numbers or four-digit calendar years. These should never be grouped not sailed in 1,492 , but dynasty collapsed around 10,400  BC or by 13 727  AD , Vega will be the northern pole star . Percentages  edit  Shortcuts MOSPERCENT WPPERCENT WP In the body of non-scientificnon-technical articles, percent American English or per cent British English are commonly used 10 percent  ten percent  4.5 per cent . Ranges are written ten to twelve per cent or ten to twelve percent , not tentwelve per cent or ten to twelve    . In the body of scientific technical articles, and in tables and infoboxes of any article, the symbol  unspaced is more common 3 , not 3    or three    . Ranges 1012 , not 1012 or 10 to 12 . When expressing the difference between two percentages, do not confuse a percentage change with a change in percentage points . Scientific and engineering notation  edit  Scientific notation always has a single nonzero digit to the left of the point not 60.22  10 22 , but 6.022  10 23 . Engineering notation is similar, but adjusted so that the exponent is a multiple of three 602.2  10 21 .

In a table column or other presentation in which all values can be expressed with a single power of 10, consider giving e.g.  10 7 once in the column header, and omitting it in the individual entries. Markup e7  In both notations, the number of digits indicates the precision. For example, 5  10 3 means rounded to the nearest thousand 5.0  10 3 to the nearest hundred 5.00  10 3 to the nearest ten and 5.000  10 3 to the nearest unit. Markup  val  and  e  may be used to format exponential notation. Uncertainty and rounding  edit  Shortcuts MOSUNCERTAINTY MOSLARGENUM Where explicit uncertainty information such as a margin of error  is available and appropriate for inclusion, it may be written in various ways 1.534  0.035  10 23 m 12.34   m 2  5 not used with scientific notation 15.34 0.43 0.23  10 23 m 1.60448  10 4 J equivalent to 1.604  0.048  10 4 J  h  Polls estimated Joness share of the vote would be 55 percent, give or take about 3 percent Markup  -  ,  su  , and  val  may be used to format uncertainties. Where explicit uncertainty is unavailable or is unimportant for the articles purposes round to an appropriate number of significant digits  the precision presented should usually be conservative. Precise values often given in sources for formal or matter-of-record reasons should be used only where stable and appropriate to the context, or significant in themselves for some special reason.

The number of decimal places should be consistent within a list or context  The response rates were 41.0 and 47.4 percent, respectively , not 41 and 47.4 percent , unless different precisions are actually intended. It may sometimes be appropriate to note the lack of uncertainty information, especially where such information is normally provided and necessary for full interpretation of the figures supplied. A local newspaper poll predicted 52 percent of the vote would go to Smith, but did not include information on the uncertainty of this estimate The  undue precision  template may be added to figures appearing to be overprecise. Avoid using approximately, about, and similar terms with figures that have merely been approximated or rounded in a normal and expected way, unless the reader might otherwise be misled. The tallest player was 6 feet 3 inches  not ... about 6 feet 3 inches    heights are conventionally reported only to the nearest inch, even though greater precision may be available in principle but The witness said the assailant was about 5 feet 8 inches tall about because here the precise value is unknown, with substantial uncertainty The reader may be assumed to interpret large round numbers  100,000 troops  as approximations.

Units of measurement  edit  Shortcuts WPUNIT WPUNITS WPMETRIC WPMEASUREMENT Unit choice and order  edit  Quantities are typically expressed using an appropriate primary unit, displayed first, followed, when appropriate, by a conversion in parentheses e.g. 200 kilometres 120  mi . For details on when and how to provide a conversion, see the section   Unit conversions . The choice of primary units depends on the circumstances, and should respect the principle of  strong national ties , where applicable In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United States , the primary units are US customary , e.g. 97   pounds 44   kg . In non-scientific articles with strong ties to the United Kingdom , the primary units for most quantities are metric or other internationally used units, j  except that UK engineering-related articles, including those on bridges and tunnels, generally use the system of units that the topic was drawn up in but road distances are given in imperial units, with a metric conversion  see next bullet the primary units for distance length, speed and fuel consumption are miles, miles per hour, and miles per imperial gallon except for short distances or lengths, where miles are too large for practical use the primary units for personal height and weight are feet inches and stones pounds imperial pints are used for quantities of draught beer cider and bottled milk In all other articles , the primary units chosen will be SI units, non-SI units officially accepted for use with the SI , or such other units as are conventional in reliable-source discussions of the article topic such as revolutions per minute rpm for rotational speed , hands for heights of horses, et cetera. Special considerations Quantities set via definition as opposed to measured quantities should be given first in the units used in the definition, even if this makes the structure of presentation inconsistent During metrification, the speed limit was changed from 30   mph 48   kmh to 50   kmh 31   mph . Or use about to emphasize which is the statutory, exact value ...from 30   mph about 48   kmh to 50   kmh about 31   mph . Nominal quantities e.g. 2      4 lumber  require consideration of whether the article is concerned with the items actual dimensions or merely with its function. In some cases, the nominal quantity may suffice in others it may be necessary to give the nominal size often in non-SI units, the actual size in non-SI units, and the actual size in SI units. Whenever a conversion is used, ensure that the precision of the converted quantity in the article is comparable to the precision of the value given by the source see   Unit conversions  . Where the articles primary units differ from the units given in the source, the  convert  templates orderflip flag can be used this causes the original unit to be shown as secondary in the article, and the converted unit to be shown as primary convert200mikmorderflip  The two cities are 320 kilometres 200  mi apart.

But in science-related articles, supplying such conversion is not required unless there is some special reason to do so. Where an imperial unit is not part of the US customary system , or vice versa    and in particular, where those systems give a single term different definitions    a double conversion may be appropriate Rosie weighed 80 kilograms 180  lb 12  st 8  lb markup convert80kglb stlb  The car had a fuel economy of 5  L100  km 47  mpg US  56  mpg imp  markup convert5L100kmmpgus mpgimpabbron .

When units are part of the subject of a topic    nautical miles in articles about the history of nautical law  5 nautical miles , SI units in scientific articles  a 600-kilometer asteroid , yards in articles about American football    it can be excessive to provide conversions every time a unit occurs. It might be best to note that this topic will use the units possibly giving the conversion factor to another familiar unit in a parenthetical note or a footnote, and link the first occurrence of each unit but not give a conversion every time it occurs. Converted quantity values should use a level of precision similar to that of the source quantity value, so the Moon is 380,000   kilometres 240,000   mi from Earth , not 236,121   mi . Small numbers, especially if approximate, may need to be converted to a range where rounding would cause a significant distortion, so about one mile 12   km , not about one mile 2   km . Be careful especially when your source has already converted from the units youre now converting back to. This may be evidenced by multiples of common conversion factors in the data, such as 160 km from 100 miles. See false precision . Conversion templates can be used to convert and format many common units, including  convert  , which includes non-breaking spaces. In a direct quotation , always retain the source units. Any conversions can be supplied either in the quote itself in square brackets, following the original measurement or in a footnote. See footnoting and citing sources .

Exception Certain units are generally represented by their symbols e.g. C rather than degrees Celsius  even on first use, though their unit names may be used for emphasis or clarity  conversion of degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit . Exception Consider using inches but not in.  in place of in where the latter might be misread as a preposition   but not where the value is followed by a parenthesized conversion e.g. bolts 5  in 12.7  cm long , or is part of such a conversion  bolts 12.7  cm 5  in long .

Articles following this practice should specify on first use whether the use refers to the small calorie or to the kilocalorie large calorie. Providing conversions to SI units usually calories to joules or kilocalories to kilojoules may also be useful. A kilocalorie  kcal  is 1000 calories. A calorie small calorie is the amount of energy required to heat 1 gram of water by 1 C. A kilocalorie is therefore also a kilogram calorie. kilocalorie large calorie kilogram calorie  not Calorie    can be ambiguous kcal Quantities of bytes and bits  edit  Shortcut WPCOMPUNITS In quantities of bits and bytes , the prefixes kilo- symbol k or K , mega-  M , giga-  G , tera-  T , etc., are ambiguous in general usage. The meaning may be based on a decimal system like the standard SI prefixes, meaning 10 3 , 10 6 , 10 9 , 10 12 , etc., or it may be based on a binary system, meaning 2 10 , 2 20 , 2 30 , 2 40 , etc. The binary meanings are more commonly used in relation to solid-state memory such as RAM , while the decimal meanings are more common for data transmission rates, disk storage and in theoretical calculations in modern academic textbooks.

If, under the exceptions detailed further below, the article otherwise uses IEC prefixes for binary units, use Ki instead. Do not assume that the binary or decimal meaning of prefixes will be obvious to everyone. Explicitly specify the meaning of k and K as well as the primary meaning of M, G, T, etc. in an article   BDprefix  is a convenient helper. Consistency within each article is desirable, but the need for consistency may be balanced with other considerations. The definition most relevant to the article should be chosen as primary for that article, e.g. specify a binary definition in an article on RAM, decimal definition in an article on hard drives , bit rates , and a binary definition for Windows file sizes, despite files usually being stored on hard drives. Where consistency is not possible, specify wherever there is a deviation from the primary definition. Disambiguation should be shown in bytes or bits, with clear indication of whether in binary or decimal base. There is no preference in the way to indicate the number of bytes and bits, but the notation style should be consistent within an article. Acceptable examples include A 64   MB  64      1024 2 -byte video card and a 100   GB 100      1000 3 -byte hard drive A 64   MB  64      2 20 -byte video card and a 100   GB 100      10 9 -byte hard drive A 64   MB 67,108,864-byte video card and a 100   GB 100,000,000,000-byte hard drive Avoid inconsistent combinations such as A 64   MB 67,108,864-byte video card and a 100   GB 100      1000 3 -byte hard drive . Footnotes, such as those seen in Power Macintosh 5500 , may be used for disambiguation. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, one byte is eight bits see Byte   History  . The IEC prefixes kibi- symbol Ki , mebi-  Mi , gibi-  Gi , etc., are generally not to be used except m  when the majority of cited sources on the article topic use IEC prefixes in a direct quote using the IEC prefixes when explicitly discussing the IEC prefixes or in articles in which both types of prefix are used with neither clearly primary, or in which converting all quantities to one or the other type would be misleading or lose necessary precision, or declaring the actual meaning of a unit on each use would be impractical. Currencies and monetary values  edit  Shortcuts WP WP  WP MOSCURRENCY WPCURRENCY redirects here. For the WikiProject focusing on articles about currencies, see WikipediaWikiProject Numismatics . See also WikipediaWikiProject NumismaticsStyle   Article titles Choice of currency In country-specific articles , such as Economy of Australia , use the currency of the subject country. In non-country-specific articles such as Wealth , use US dollars  US123 on first use, generally 123 thereafter, euros  123 , or pounds sterling  123 . Currency names Do not capitalize the names or denominations of currencies, currency subdivisions, coins and banknotes not a Five-Dollar bill, four Quarters, and one Penny total six Dollars one Cent but a five-dollar bill, four quarters, and one penny total six dollars one cent . Exception where otherwise required, as at the start of a sentence or in such forms as Australian dollar . To pluralize euro use the standard English plurals  ten euros and fifty cents , not the invariant plurals used for European Union legislation and banknotes  ten euro and fifty cent . For the adjectival form, use a hyphenated singular  a two-euro pen and a ten-cent coin . Link the first occurrence of lesser-known currencies  Mongolian tgrgs . Currency symbols In general, the first mention of a particular currency should use its full, unambiguous signifier e.g. A52 , with subsequent references using just the appropriate symbol e.g. 88 , unless this would be unclear. Exceptions In an article referring to multiple currencies represented by the same symbol e.g. the dollars of the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries    see Currency symbols   dollar variants  use the full signifier e.g. US or A , but not e.g. US123 or 123 US  each time, except possibly where a particular context makes this both unnecessary and undesirable. In articles entirely on EU-, UK- andor US-related topics, all occurrences may be shortened  26 , 22 or 34 , unless this would be unclear. For the British pound sterling GBP, use the  symbol, with one horizontal bar, not the double-barred  . For non-British currencies that use pounds or a pound symbol e.g. the Irish pound , IR, the Italian lira  use the symbol conventionally preferred for that currency. If there is no common English abbreviation or symbol, follow the ISO 4217 standard. See also List of circulating currencies . Formatting A period full stop, .     never a comma    is used as the decimal point  6.57 , not 6,57 . For the grouping of digits e.g. 1,234,567  see   Grouping of digits , above. Do not place a currency symbol after the accompanying numeric figures e.g. 123 , 123  , 123   unless that is the normal convention for that symbol when writing in English smaller British coins include 1p, 2p, and 5p denominations . Currency abbreviations that come before the numeric value are unspaced if they consist of a nonalphabetic symbol alone  123 or 123 , or end with a nonalphabetic symbol  R 123  but spaced if completely alphabetic  R   123 or JD   123 . Ranges should be expressed giving the currency signifier just once 250300 , not 250300 . million and billion should be spelled out on first use, and optionally abbreviated M or bn both unspaced thereafter She received 70 million and her son 10M  the schools share was 250300 million, and the charitys 400450M . In general, a currency symbol should be accompanied by a numeric amount e.g. not He converted his US to A but He converted his US dollars to Australian dollars or He exchanged the US100 note for Australian dollars . Exceptions may occur in tables and infoboxes where space is limited e.g. Currencies accepted US , SFr , GB  ,  . It may be appropriate to wikilink such uses, or add an explanatory note. Conversions Conversions of less-familiar currencies may be provided in terms of more familiar currencies    such as the US dollar, euro or pound sterling    using an appropriate rate which is often not the current exchange rate. Conversions should be in parentheses after the original currency, along with the convert-to year e.g. grant in 2001 was 10,000,000 Swedish kronor 1.4M, 970,000, or 850,000 as of 2009 update   For obsolete currencies , provide an equivalent formatted as a conversion if possible, in the modern replacement currency e.g. decimal pounds for historical pre-decimal pounds-and-shillings, or a US-dollar equivalent where there is no modern equivalent. In some cases, it may be appropriate to provide a conversion accounting for inflation or deflation over time. See  Inflation  and  Inflation-fn  . When converting among currencies or inflatingdeflating, it is rarely appropriate to give the converted amount to more than three significant figures typically, only two significant figures are justified grant in 2001 was 10,000,000 Swedish kronor 1.4M, 970,000, or 850,000 , not 1,390,570, 971,673 or 848,646 Common mathematical symbols  edit  Shortcuts WPCOMMONMATH MOSMINUS See also WikipediaManual of StyleMathematics and HelpDisplaying a formula The Insert menu below the editing window gives a more complete list of math symbols, and allows symbols to be inserted without the HTML encoding e.g. divide  shown here.

Trailing zeros should be used as needed to ensure that both values have the same level of precision. London Heathrow Airport , Amsterdam , Jan Mayen and Mount Baker are examples of articles that contain geographical coordinates. Generally, the larger the object being mapped, the less precise the coordinates should be. For example, if just giving the location of a city, precision greater than 100   meters is not needed unless specifying a particular point in the city, for example the central administrative building. Specific buildings or other objects of similar size would justify precisions down to 10   meters or even one meter in some cases 1 15   m to 30   m, 0.0001 5.6   m to 10   m.

When adding coordinates, please remove the  coord missing  tag from the article, if present. For more information, see the geographical coordinates WikiProject .

Only certain citation styles use abbreviated date formats. By default, Wikipedia does not abbreviate dates. Use a consistent citation style within any one article.  All-numeric yyyy - mm - dd dates might be assumed to follow the ISO 8601 standard, which mandates the Gregorian calendar. Also, technically all must be four-digit years, but Wikipedia is unlikely to ever need to format a far-future date beyond the year 9999.  The routine linking of dates is deprecated. This change was made August 24, 2008, on the basis of this archived discussion . It was ratified in two December 2008 RfCs WikipediaManual of StyleDates and numbersThree proposals for change to MOSNUM and WikipediaManual of StyleDates and numbersDate Linking RFC .  For consensus discussion on abbreviated date formats like Sep 2, see Wikipedia talkManual of StyleArchive 151   RFC Month abbreviations .  These formats cannot, in general, be distinguished on sight, because there are usages in which 03-04-2007 represents March   4, and other usages in which it represents April   3. In contrast, there is no common usage in which 2007-04-03 represents anything other than April   3.  A change from a preference for two digits, to a preference for four digits, on the right side of yearyear ranges was implemented in July 2016 per this RFC .  The number in parentheses in a construction like 1.60448  10 4 J is the numerical value of the standard uncertainty referred to the corresponding last digits of the quoted result. 2   The 0x and 0 prefixes, but not 0b , are borrowed from the C programming language .  If there is disagreement about the primary units used in a UK-related article, discuss the matter on the article talk-page or at Wikipedia talkManual of StyleDates and numbers  WTMOSNUM . If consensus cannot be reached, refer to historically stable versions of the article and retain the units used in these as the primary units. Also note the style guides of British publications e.g. The Times , under Metric.  See, e.g., WikipediaGeneral sanctionsUnits in the United Kingdom .  These definitions are consistent with all units of measure mentioned in the SI Brochure 3  and with all units of measure catalogued in EU directive 80181EEC . 4   Wikipedia follows common practice regarding bytes and other data traditionally quantified using binary prefixes e.g. mega- and kilo- , meaning 2 20 and 2 10 respectively and their unit symbols e.g. MB and KB  for RAM and decimal prefixes for most other uses. Despite the IECs 1998 international standard creating several new binary prefixes e.g. mebi-, kibi-, etc. to distinguish the meaning of the decimal SI prefixes e.g. mega- and kilo- , meaning 10 6 and 10 3 respectively from the binary ones, and the subsequent incorporation of these IEC prefixes into the ISOIEC 80000 , consensus on Wikipedia in computing-related contexts favours the retention of the more familiar but ambiguous units KB , MB , GB , TB , PB , EB , etc. over use of unambiguous IEC binary prefixes.
