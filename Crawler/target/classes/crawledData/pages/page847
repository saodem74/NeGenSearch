PDP-11 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Series of 16-bit minicomputers This article is about the PDP-11 series of minicomputers. For the PDP-11 processor architecture, see PDP-11 architecture . PDP-1140. The processor is at the bottom. A TU56 dual DECtape drive is installed above it. The PDP-11 is a series of 16-bit minicomputers sold by Digital Equipment Corporation DEC from 1970 into the 1990s, one of a succession of products in the PDP series. In total, around 600,000 PDP-11s of all models were sold, making it one of DECs most successful product lines. The PDP-11 is considered by some experts 1  2  3  to be the most popular minicomputer ever. The PDP-11 included a number of innovative features in its instruction set and additional general-purpose registers that made it much easier to program than earlier models in the series. Additionally, the innovative Unibus system allowed external devices to be easily interfaced to the system using direct memory access , opening the system to a wide variety of peripherals . The PDP-11 replaced the PDP-8 in many real-time applications , although both product lines lived in parallel for more than 10 years. The ease of programming of the PDP-11 made it very popular for general purpose computing uses as well. The design of the PDP-11 inspired the design of late-1970s microprocessors including the Intel x86 1  and the Motorola 68000 . Design features of PDP-11 operating systems, as well as other operating systems from Digital Equipment, influenced the design of other operating systems such as CPM and hence also MS-DOS . The first officially named version of Unix ran on the PDP-1120 in 1970. It is commonly stated that the C programming language took advantage of several low-level PDP-11dependent programming features, 4  albeit not originally by design. 5  An effort to expand the PDP-11 from 16 to 32-bit addressing led to the VAX-11 design, which took part of its name from the PDP-11.

This was a 12-bit design adapted from the 1962 LINC machine that was intended to be used in a lab setting. DEC slightly simplified the LINC system and instruction set, aiming the PDP-5 at smaller settings that did not need the power of their larger 18-bit PDP-4 . The PDP-5 was a success, ultimately selling about 50,000 examples. During this period, the computer market was moving from computer word lengths based on units of 6 bits to units of 8 bits, following the introduction of the 7-bit ASCII standard. In 196768, DEC engineers designed a 16-bit machine, the PDP-X, 6  but management ultimately cancelled the project. Several of the engineers from the PDP-X left DEC and formed Data General . The next year they introduced the 16-bit Data General Nova . 7  The Nova was a major success, selling tens of thousands of units and launching what would become one of DECs major competitors through the 1970s and 80s. Release  edit  A subsequent effort, code-named Desk Calculator, looked at a variety of options before choosing what became the 16-bit PDP-11 8  The PDP-11 family was announced in January 1970 and shipments began early that year. DEC sold over 170,000 PDP-11s in the 1970s. 9  Initially manufactured of small-scale transistortransistor logic , a single-board large scale integration version of the processor was developed in 1975. A two-or-three-chip processor, the J-11 was developed in 1979. The last models of the PDP-11 line were the PDP-1194 and -1193 introduced in 1990. 10  Innovative features  edit  Instruction set orthogonality  edit  See also PDP-11 architecture The PDP-11 processor architecture has a mostly orthogonal instruction set . For example, instead of instructions such as load and store , the PDP-11 has a move instruction for which either operand source and destination can be memory or register. There are no specific input or output instructions the PDP-11 uses memory-mapped IO and so the same move instruction is used orthogonality even enables moving data directly from an input device to an output device. More complex instructions such as add likewise can have memory, register, input, or output as source or destination. Most operands can apply any of eight addressing modes to eight registers. The addressing modes provide register, immediate, absolute, relative, deferred indirect, and indexed addressing, and can specify autoincrementation and autodecrementation of a register by one byte instructions or two word instructions. Use of relative addressing lets a machine-language program be position-independent . No dedicated IO instructions  edit  Early models of the PDP-11 had no dedicated bus for inputoutput , but only a system bus called the Unibus , as input and output devices were mapped to memory addresses. An inputoutput device determined the memory addresses to which it would respond, and specified its own interrupt vector and interrupt priority . This flexible framework provided by the processor architecture made it unusually easy to invent new bus devices, including devices to control hardware that had not been contemplated when the processor was originally designed. DEC openly published the basic Unibus specifications, even offering prototyping bus interface circuit boards, and encouraging customers to develop their own Unibus-compatible hardware. The Unibus made the PDP-11 suitable for custom peripherals. One of the predecessors of Alcatel-Lucent , the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company , developed the BTMC DPS-1500 packet-switching  X.25  network and used PDP-11s in the regional and national network management system, with the Unibus directly connected to the DPS-1500 hardware. Higher-performance members of the PDP-11 family, starting with the PDP-1145 Unibus and 1183 Q-bus systems, departed from the single-bus approach. Instead, memory was interfaced by dedicated circuitry and space in the CPU cabinet, while the Unibus continued to be used for IO only. In the PDP-1170, this was taken a step further, with the addition of a dedicated interface between disks and tapes and memory, via the Massbus . Although inputoutput devices continued to be mapped into memory addresses, some additional programming was necessary to set up the added bus interfaces. Interrupts  edit  The PDP-11 supports hardware interrupts at four priority levels. Interrupts are serviced by software service routines, which could specify whether they themselves could be interrupted achieving interrupt nesting . The event that causes the interrupt is indicated by the device itself, as it informs the processor of the address of its own interrupt vector. Interrupt vectors are blocks of two 16-bit words in low kernel address space which normally corresponded to low physical memory between 0 and 776. The first word of the interrupt vector contains the address of the interrupt service routine and the second word the value to be loaded into the PSW priority level on entry to the service routine. The article on PDP-11 architecture provides more details on interrupts. Designed for mass production  edit  The PDP-11 was designed for ease of manufacture by semiskilled labor. The dimensions of its pieces were relatively non-critical. It used a wire-wrapped backplane . That is, the printed circuit boards plugged into a backplane connector. The backplane connectors had square pins that could be connected to by wrapping wires around them. The corners of the pins would bite into the wire to form a gas-tight i.e. corrosion-proof, therefore reliable connection. LSI-11  edit  Q-Bus board with LSI-112 CPU DEC Fonz-11 F11 Chipset DEC Jaws-11 J11 Chipset The LSI-11 PDP-1103, introduced in February 1975 10  is the first PDP-11 model produced using large-scale integration  the entire CPU is contained on four LSI chips made by Western Digital the MCP-1600 chip set a fifth chip can be added to extend the instruction set, as pictured on the right. It uses a bus which is a close variant of the Unibus called the LSI Bus or Q-Bus  it differs from the Unibus primarily in that addresses and data are multiplexed onto a shared set of wires rather than having separate sets of wires. It also differs slightly in how it addresses IO devices and it eventually allowed a 22-bit physical address whereas the Unibus only allows an 18-bit physical address and block-mode operations for significantly improved bandwi dth which the Unibus does not support. The CPU microcode includes a debugger  firmware with a direct serial interface  RS-232 or current loop  to a terminal . This lets the operator do debugging by typing commands and reading octal numbers, rather than operating switches and reading lights, the typical debugging method at the time. The operator can thus examine and modify the computers registers, memory, and inputoutput devices, diagnosing and perhaps correcting failures in software and peripherals unless a failure disables the microcode itself. The operator can also specify which disk to boot from. Both innovations increased the reliability and decreased the cost of the LSI-11. Later Q-Bus based systems such as the LSI-1123, 73, and 83 are based upon chip sets designed in house by Digital Equipment Corporation. Later PDP-11 Unibus systems were designed to use similar Q-Bus processor cards, using a Unibus adapter to support existing Unibus peripherals , sometimes with a special memory bus for improved speed. There were other significant innovations in the Q-Bus lineup. For example, a system variant of the PDP-1103 introduced full system power-on self-test POST. Decline  edit  The basic design of the PDP-11 was flexible, and was continually updated to use newer technologies. However, the limited throughput of the Unibus and Q-bus started to become a system-performance bottleneck , and the 16-bit logical address limitation hampered the development of larger software applications. The article on PDP-11 architecture describes the hardware and software techniques used to work around address-space limitations. DECs 32-bit successor to the PDP-11, the VAX for Virtual Address eXtension overcame the 16-bit limitation, but was initially a superminicomputer aimed at the high-end time-sharing market. The early VAX CPUs provided a PDP-11 compatibility mode under which much existing software could be immediately used, in parallel with newer 32-bit software, but this capability was dropped with the first MicroVAX . For a decade the PDP-11 was the smallest system that could run Unix , 11  but in the 1980s, the IBM PC and its clones largely took over the small computer market BYTE in 1984 reported that the PCs Intel 8088 microprocessor outperformed the PDP-1123 when running Unix. 12  Newer microprocessors such as the Motorola 68000 1979 and Intel 80386 1985 also included 32-bit logical addressing. The 68000 in particular facilitated the emergence of a market of increasingly powerful scientific and technical workstations that would often run Unix variants. These included the HP 9000 series 200 starting with the HP 9826A in 1981 and 300400, with the HP-UX system being ported to the 68000 in 1984 Sun Microsystems workstations running SunOS , starting with the Sun-1 in 1982 Apollo Domain workstations starting with the DN100 in 1981 running DomainOS , which was proprietary but offered a degree of Unix compatibility and the Silicon Graphics IRIS range, which developed into Unix-based workstations by 1985 IRIS 2000. Personal computers based on the 68000 like the Apple Lisa and Macintosh or the Commodore Amiga arguably constituted less of a threat to DECs business, although technically these systems could also run Unix derivatives. In the early years, in particular, Microsoft s Xenix was ported to systems like the TRS-80 Model 16 with up to 1 MB of memory in 1983, and to the Apple Lisa, with up to 2 MB of installed RAM, in 1984. The mass-production of those chips eliminated any cost advantage for the 16-bit PDP-11. A line of personal computers based on the PDP-11, the DEC Professional series, failed commercially, along with other non-PDP-11 PC offerings from DEC. In 1994 DEC 13  sold the PDP-11 system-software rights to Mentec Inc., an Irish producer of LSI-11 based boards for Q-Bus and ISA architecture personal computers, and in 1997 discontinued PDP-11 production. For several years, Mentec produced new PDP-11 processors. Other companies found a niche market for replacements for legacy PDP-11 processors, disk subsystems, etc. By the late 1990s, not only DEC but most of the New England computer industry which had been built around minicomputers similar to the PDP-11 collapsed in the face of microcomputer-based workstations and servers. Models  edit  The PDP-11 processors tend to fall into several natural groups depending on the original design upon which they are based and which IO bus they use. Within each group, most models were offered in two versions, one intended for OEMs and one intended for end-users. Although all models share the same instruction set, later models added new instructions and interpreted certain instructions slightly differently. As the architecture evolved, there were also variations in handling of some processor status and control registers. Unibus models  edit  Original PDP-1120 front panel Original PDP-1170 front panel Later PDP-1170 with disks and tape The following models use the Unibus as their principal bus PDP-1120 and PDP-1115  The original, non-microprogrammed processor designed by Jim OLoughlin. Floating point is supported by peripheral options using various data formats. The 1120 lacks any kind of memory protection hardware unless retrofitted with a KS-11 memory mapping add-on. 14  PDP-1145, PDP-1150, and PDP-1155  A much faster microprogrammed processor that can use up to 256   kB of semiconductor memory instead of or in addition to core memory  support memory mapping and protection. 14  First model to support an optional FP11 floating-point coprocessor , which established the format used in later models. PDP-1135 and PDP-1140  Microprogrammed successors to the PDP-1120 the design team was led by Jim OLoughlin. PDP-1105 and PDP-1110  A cost-reduced successor to the PDP-1120. PDP-1170  The 1145 architecture expanded to allow 4   MB of physical memory segregated onto a private memory bus, 2  kB of cache memory, and much faster IO devices connected via the Massbus. PDP-1134 and PDP-1104  Cost-reduced follow-on products to the 1135 and 1105 the PDP-1134 concept was created by Bob Armstrong. The 1134 supports up to 256  kB of Unibus memory. The PDP-1134a supports a fast floating-point option, and the 1134c supported a cache memory option. PDP-1160  A PDP-11 with user-writable microcontrol store this was designed by another team led by Jim OLoughlin. PDP-1144  A replacement for the 1145 and 1170, introduced in 1980, that supports optional though apparently always included cache memory, FP-11 floating-point processor one circuit board, using sixteen AMD Am2901 bit slice processors, and commercial instruction set CIS, two boards. It includes a sophisticated serial console interface and support for 4  MB of physical memory. The design team was managed by John Sofio. This was the last PDP-11 processor to be constructed using discrete logic gates  later models were all microprocessor-based. It was also the last PDP-11 architecture created by Digital Equipment Corporation , later models were VLSI chip realizations of the existing system architectures. PDP-1124  First VLSI PDP-11 for Unibus, using the Fonz-11 F11 chip set with a Unibus adapter. PDP-1184  Using the VLSI Jaws-11 J11 chip set with a Unibus adapter. PDP-1194  J11-based, faster than 1184. Q-bus models  edit  PDP-1103, cover removed to show the CPU board, with memory board beneath. Two of the CPU chipsets four 40-pin packages have been removed, and the optional FPU is also missing. The following models use the Q-Bus as their principal bus PDP-1103 also known as the LSI-1103  The first PDP-11 implemented with large-scale integration ICs, this system uses a four-package MCP-1600 chipset from Western Digital and supports 60  kB of memory. PDP-1123  Second generation of LSI F-11. Early units supported only 248  kB of memory. PDP-1123MicroPDP-1123  Improved 1123 with more functions on the larger processor card.

DECserver 500 and 550 LAT terminal servers DSRVS-BA using the KDJ11-SB chipset Models without standard bus  edit  PDT-11150 PDT-11110 PDT-11130 PDT-11150 The PDT series were desktop systems marketed as smart terminals. The 110 and 130 were housed in a VT100 terminal enclosure. The 150 was housed in a table-top unit which included two 8-inch floppy drives, three asynchronous serial ports, one printer port, one modem port and one synchronous serial port and required an external terminal. All three employed the same chipset as used on the LSI-1103 and LSI-112 in four microms. There is an option which combines two of the microms into one dual carrier, freeing one socket for an EISFIS chip. The 150 in combination with a VT105 terminal was also sold as MiniMINC , a budget version of the MINC-11 . PRO-325 PRO-350 PRO-380 The DEC Professional series are desktop PCs intended to compete with IBMs earlier 8088 and 80286 based personal computers. The models are equipped with 5 inch floppy disk drives and hard disks, except the 325 which has no hard disk. The original operating system was POS, which was essentially RSX-11 M with a menu system on top. As the design was intended to avoid software exchange with existing PDP-11 models, their ill fate in the market was no surprise for anyone except DEC. The RT-11 operating system was eventually ported to the PRO series. A port of RSTSE to the PRO series was also done internal to DEC, but it was not released. The PRO-325 and -350 units are based on the DCF-11 Fonz chipset, the same as found in the 1123, 1123 and 1124. The PRO-380 is based on the DCJ-11 Jaws chipset, the same as found in the 1153,73,83 and others, though running only at 10  MHz because of limitations in the support chipset. Models that were planned but never introduced  edit  PDP-1127  A Jaws-11 implementation that would have used the VAXBI Bus as its principal IO bus. PDP-1168  A follow-on to the PDP-1160 that would have supported 4  MB of physical memory. PDP-1174  A PDP-1170 that was extended to contain multiprocessing features. Up to four processors could be interconnected, although the physical cable management became unwieldy. Another variation on the 1174 contained both the multiprocessing features and the Commercial Instruction Set. A substantial number of prototype 1174s of various types were built and at least two multiprocessor systems were sent to customers for beta testing, but no systems were ever officially sold. A four processor system was maintained by the RSX-11 operating system development team for testing and a uniprocessor system served PDP-11 engineering for general purpose timesharing. The 1174 was due to be introduced around the same time as the announcement of the new 32-bit product line and the first model the VAX 11780. The 1174 was cancelled because of concern for its field maintainability, 16  though employees believed the real reason was that it outperformed the 11780 17  and would inhibit its sales. In any case, DEC never entirely migrated its PDP-11 customer base to the VAX. The primary reason was not performance, but the PDP-11s superior real-time responsiveness.  citation needed  Special purpose versions  edit  DEC GT40 running Moonlander MINC-23 GT40  VT11 vector graphics terminal using a PDP-1105.

When VT173 inventory was exhausted in 1985, Digital discontinued DECset and transferred its customer agreements to Datalogics. HP now uses the name HP DECset for a software development toolset product. MINC-11  Laboratory system based on 1103 or 1123 18  when based on the 1123, it was sold as a MINC-23, but many MINC-11 machines were field-upgraded with the 1123 processor. Early versions of the MINC-specific software package would not run on the 1123 processor because of subtle changes in the instruction set MINC 1.2 is documented as compatible with the later processor.

The RTI has two serial line units one connects to the VAX environmental monitoring module EMM and the other is a spare that could be used for data transfer. The RTI also has a programmable peripheral interface PPI consisting of three 8-bit ports for transferring data, address, and control signals between console and the VAX console interface. 20  Unlicensed clones  edit  The PDP-11 was sufficiently popular that many unlicensed PDP-11-compatible minicomputers and microcomputers were produced in Eastern Bloc countries. Some were pin-compatible with the PDP-11 and could use its peripherals and system software. These include SM-4 , SM-1420 , SM-1600 , Electronika 100-25 , Electronika BK series, Electronika 60 , Electronika 85 , DVK and UKNC in the Soviet Union .

It was used as a standard minicomputer for general-purpose computing, such as timesharing , scientific, educational, medical, or business computing. Another common application was real-time process control and factory automation . Some OEM models were also frequently used as embedded systems to control complex systems like traffic-light systems, medical systems, numerical controlled machining , or for network-management. An example of such use of PDP-11s was the management of the packet switched network Datanet 1. In the 1980s, the UKs air traffic control radar processing was conducted on a PDP 1134 system known as PRDS  Processed Radar Display System at RAF West Drayton.  citation needed  The software for the Therac-25 medical linear particle accelerator also ran on a 32K PDP 1123. 31  In 2013, it was reported that PDP-11 programmers would be needed to control nuclear power plants through 2050. 32  Another use was for storage of test programs for Teradyne ATE equipment, in a system known as the TSD Test System Director. As such, they were in use until their software was rendered inoperable by the Year 2000 problem . The U.S. Navy used a PDP-1134 to control its Multi-station Spatial Disorientation Device, a simulator used in pilot training, until 2007, when it was replaced by a PC-based emulator that could run the original PDP-11 software and interface with custom Unibus controller cards. 33  A PDP-1145 was used for the experiment that discovered the J meson at the Brookhaven National Laboratory . 34  In 1976, Samuel C. C. Ting received the Nobel Prize for this discovery. Emulators  edit  Ersatz-11  edit  Ersatz-11, a product of D Bit, 35  emulates the PDP-11 instruction set running under DOS, OS2, Windows, Linux or stand-alone no OS. It can be used to run RSTS or other PDP-11 operating systems.
