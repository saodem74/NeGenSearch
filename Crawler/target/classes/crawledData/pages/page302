He has designed several programming languages , including Pascal , and pioneered several classic topics in software engineering . In 1984 he won the Turing Award , generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, 2  3  for developing a sequence of innovative computer languages. 4  Contents 1 Biography 2 Programming languages 3 Publications 4 Wirths law 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Biography  edit  Wirth was born in Winterthur , Switzerland, in 1934. In 1959 he earned a degree in Electronics Engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zrich ETH Zrich. In 1960 he earned an M.Sc. from Universit Laval , Canada. Then in 1963 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science EECS from the University of California, Berkeley , supervised by the computer designer pioneer Harry Huskey . From 1963 to 1967 he served as assistant professor of Computer Science at Stanford University and again at the University of Zurich . Then in 1968 he became Professor of Informatics at ETH Zrich, taking two one-year sabbaticals at Xerox PARC in California 19761977 and 19841985. Wirth retired in 1999. In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for seminal work in programming languages and algorithms, including Euler, Algol-W, Pascal, Modula, and Oberon. 5  Programming languages  edit  Niklaus Wirth, 1969 Wirth was the chief designer of the programming languages Euler , Algol W , Pascal , 6  Modula , Modula-2 , Oberon , Oberon-2 , and Oberon-07 . He was also a major part of the design and implementation team for the Lilith and Oberon operating systems, and for the Lola digital hardware design and simulation system. He received the Association for Computing Machinery ACM Turing Award for the development of these languages in 1984 and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. Publications  edit  His book, written jointly with Kathleen Jensen, The Pascal User Manual and Report , served as the basis of many language implementation efforts in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States and across Europe.  citation needed  His article Program Development by Stepwise Refinement , about the teaching of programming, is considered to be a classic text in software engineering . 7  In 1975 he wrote the book Algorithms  Data Structures  Programs , which gained wide recognition. 8  Major revisions of this book with the new title Algorithms  Data Structures were published in 1985 and 2004. The examples in the first edition were written in Pascal. These were replaced in the later editions with examples written in Modula-2 and Oberon respectively. His textbook, Systematic Programming An Introduction , was considered a good source for students who wanted to do more than just coding.  citation needed   clarification needed  Regarded  by whom  as a challenging text to work through, it was sought as imperative reading for those interested in numerical mathematics. 9  Signature of Niklaus Wirth In 1992 he published together with Jrg Gutknecht  the full documentation of the Oberon OS . 10  . A second book together with Martin Reiser was intended as a programmers guide. 11  Wirths law  edit  Main article Wirths law In 1995, he popularized the adage now known as Wirths law , which states that software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware becomes faster. In his 1995 paper A Plea for Lean Software he attributes it to Martin Reiser . 12  See also  edit  Asteroid 21655 Niklauswirth Extended BackusNaur Form Wirth syntax notation Bucky bit WirthWeber precedence relationship List of pioneers in computer science References  edit   Niklaus Wirth 2004 Fellow  Dasgupta, Sanjoy Papadimitriou, Christos  Vazirani, Umesh 2008.
