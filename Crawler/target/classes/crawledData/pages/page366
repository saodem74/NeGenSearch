Architectural engineering From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Csar Pelli s Ratner Athletic Center uses cables and masts as load-bearing devices. Architectural engineering , also known as building engineering or architecture engineering , is a discipline that deals with the technological aspects and multi-disciplinary approach to planning , design , construction and operation of buildings , such as analysis and integrated design of environmental systems  energy conservation , HVAC , lighting , acoustics , vertical and horizontal transportation, structural systems , behavior and properties of building components and materials, and construction management . 1  2  From reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the construction of resilient buildings, architectural engineers are at the forefront of addressing several major challenges of the 21st century. They apply the latest scientific knowledge and technologies to the design of buildings . Architectural engineering as a relatively new licensed profession emerged in the 20th century as a result of the rapid technological developments. Architectural engineers are at the forefront of two major historical opportunities that todays world is immersed in 1 that of rapidly advancing computer-technology, and 2 the parallel revolution arising from the need to creat e a sustainable planet. 3  Distinguished from architecture as an art of design , architectural Engineering, is the art and science of engineering and construction as practiced in respect of buildings . 4  Contents 1 Related engineering and design fields 1.1 Structural engineering 1.2 Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing MEP 2 The architectural engineer PE in the United States 3 The architect as architectural engineer 4 Education 4.1 Architectural engineering as a single integrated field of study 5 See also 6 References Related engineering and design fields  edit  Structural engineering  edit  Main article Structural engineering Structural engineering involves the analysis and design of the built environment buildings, bridges, equipment supports, towers and walls. Those concentrating on buildings are sometimes informally referred to as building engineers. Structural engineers require expertise in strength of materials , structural analysis , and in predicting structural load such as from weight of the building, occupants and contents, and extreme events such as wind, rain, ice, and seismic design of structures which is referred to as earthquake engineering . Architectural Engineers sometimes incorporate structural as one aspect of their designs the structural discipline when practiced as a specialty works closely with architects and other engineering specialists. Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing MEP  edit  Main article Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing MEP room in a building Mechanical engineering and electrical engineering engineers are specialists, commonly referred to as  Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing  when engaged in the building design fields. Also known as  building services engineering  in the United Kingdom , Canada and Australia . 5  Mechanical engineers often design and oversee the heating, ventilation and air conditioning HVAC, plumbing and rain gutter systems. Plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple active fire protection systems, but for more complicated projects, fire protection engineers are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are responsible for the buildings power distribution , telecommunication , fire alarm , signalization, lightning protection and control systems , as well as lighting systems The architectural engineer PE in the United States  edit  Main article Architectural engineer PE In many jurisdictions of the United States, the architectural engineer is a licensed engineering professional. 6  Usually a graduate of an architectural engineering university program preparing students to perform whole-building design in competition with architect-engineer teams or for practice in one of structural, mechanical or electrical fields of building design, but with an appreciation of integrated architectural requirements. Formal architectural engineering education, following the engineering model of earlier disciplines, developed in the late 19th century, and became widespread in the United States by the mid-20th century. With the establishment of a specific architectural engineering NCEES Professional Engineering registration examination in the 1990s, and first offering in April 2003, architectural engineering became recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States. In most license-regulated jurisdictions, architectural engineers are not entitled to practice architecture unless they are also licensed as architects, and may be restricted from the practice of structural engineering on specific types of higher importance buildings such as hospitals. Regulations and customary practice vary widely by region or city. The architect as architectural engineer  edit  See also Architect   Professional requirements In some countries, the practice of architecture includes planning, designing and overseeing the buildings construction, and architecture, as a profession providing architectural services , is referred to as architectural engineering. In Japan, a first-class architect plays the dual role of architect and building engineer, although the services of a licensed structural design first-class architect are required for buildings over a certain scale. 7  In some languages, such as Korean and Arabic , architect is literally translated as architectural engineer. In some countries, an architectural engineer such as the ingegnere edile in Italy is entitled to practice architecture and is often referred to as an architect. 8   failed verification  These individuals are often also structural engineers. In other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Iran, and most of the Arab countries, architecture graduates receive an engineering degree  Dipl.-Ing.  Diplom-Ingenieur . 9  In Spain, an architect has a technical university education and legal powers to carry out building structure and facility projects. 10  In Brazil, architects and engineers used to share the same accreditation process Conselho Federal de Engenheiros, Arquitetos e Agrnomos CONFEA  Federal Council of Engineering, Architecture and Agronomy. Now the Brazilian architects and urbanists have their own accreditation process CAU  Architecture and Urbanism Council. Besides traditional architecture design training , Brazilian architecture courses also offer complementary training in engineering disciplines such as structural, electrical, hydraulic and mechanical engineering. After graduation, architects focus in architectural planning, yet they can be responsible to the whole building, when it concerns to small buildings except in electric wiring, where the architect autonomy is limited to systems up to 30kVA, and it has to be done by an Electrical Engineer, applied to buildings, urban environment, built cultural heritage, landscape planning, interiorscape planning and regional planning. 11  12  In Greece licensed architectural engineers are graduates from architecture faculties that belong to the Polytechnic University, 13  obtaining an Engineering Diploma. They graduate after 5 years of studies and are fully entitled architects once they become members of the Technical Chamber of Greece TEE    . 14  15  The Technical Chamber of Greece has more than 100,000 members encompassing all the engineering disciplines as well as architecture. A prerequisite for being a member is to be licensed as a qualified engineer or architect and to be a graduate of an engineering and architecture schools of a Greek university, or of an equivalent school from abroad. The Technical Chamber of Greece is the authorized body to provide work licenses to engineers of all disciplines as well as architects, graduated in Greece or abroad. The license is awarded after examinations. The examinations take place three to four times a year. The Engineering Diploma equals a masters degree in ECTS units 300 according to the Bologna Accords. 16  Education  edit  Further information Engineers degree The architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical engineering branches each have well established educational requirements that are usually fulfilled by completion of a university program. An air handling unit is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location click on image for legend. Bringing together knowledge of acoustic engineering and HVAC is one example of the multi-disciplined nature of architectural engineering Architectural engineering as a single integrated field of study  edit  Main article Building engineering education Its multi-disciplinary engineering approach is what differentiates architectural engineering from architecture the field of the architect which is an integrated, separate and single, field of study when compared to other engineering disciplines. Through training in and appreciation of architecture, the field seeks integration of building systems within its overall building design. Architectural engineering includes the design of building systems including heating, ventilation and air conditioning HVAC , plumbing, fire protection , electrical , lighting , architectural acoustics , and structural systems. In some university programs, students are required to concentrate on one of the systems in others, they can receive a generalist architectural or building engineering degree.
