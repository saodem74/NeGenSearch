IEC standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation, transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment, semiconductors, fibre optics, batteries, solar energy , nanotechnology and marine energy as well as many others. The IEC also manages four 6  global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment, system or components conform to its International Standards. The IEC charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution, electronics, magnetics and electromagnetics , electroacoustics , multimedia , telecommunication and medical technology , as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility by its Advisory Committee on Electromagnetic Compatibility , ACEC, measurement and performance, dependability, design and development, safety and the environment.

At that time the International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units was agreed to. The International Electrotechnical Commission held its inaugural meeting on 26 June 1906, following discussions among the British Institution of Electrical Engineers , the American Institute of Electrical Engineers , and others, which began at the 1900 Paris International Electrical Congress,  citation needed  and continued with Colonel R. E. B. Crompton playing a key role. In 1906, Lord Kelvin was elected as the first President of the International Electrotechnical Commission 7  . International Electrotechnical Commission - Central Office - Geneva The IEC was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement, particularly the gauss , hertz , and weber . 8  It also first proposed a system of standards, the Giorgi System , which ultimately became the SI , or Systme International dunits in English, the International System of Units. In 1938, it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical, electronic and related technologies. This effort continues, and the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary the on-line version of which is known as the Electropedia  remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries. The CISPR  Comit International Spcial des Perturbations Radiolectriques   in English, the International Special Committee on Radio Interference  is one of the groups founded by the IEC. Currently, 82 countries are members while another 82 participate in the Affiliate Country Programme, which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the IEC. Originally located in London , the commission moved to its current headquarters in Geneva in 1948. It has regional centres in Asia-Pacific  Singapore , Latin America  So Paulo , Brazil and North America  Boston , United States. Today, the IEC is the worlds leading international organization in its field, and its standards are adopted as national standards by its members. The work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry, government, academia, test labs and others with an interest in the subject. IEC standards  edit  See also List of IEC standards Cable with an angled IEC connector IEC 60320 C13 and an EU plug CEE 77. IEC standards have numbers in the range 6000079999 and their titles take a form such as IEC 60417 Graphical symbols for use on equipment . Following the Dresden Agreement with CENELEC the numbers of older IEC standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000, for example IEC 27 became IEC 60027. Standards of the 60000 series are also found preceded by EN to indicate that the IEC standard is also adopted by CENELEC as a European standard for example IEC 60034 is also available as EN 60034. The IEC cooperates closely with the International Organization for Standardization ISO and the International Telecommunication Union ITU . In addition, it works with several major standards development organizations, including the IEEE with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002, which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work. Standards developed jointly with ISO such as ISOIEC 26300  Open Document Format for Office Applications OpenDocument v1.0 , ISOIEC 27001  Information technology, Security techniques, Information security management systems, Requirements , and CASCO ISOIEC 17000 series, carry the acronym of both organizations. The use of the ISOIEC prefix covers publications from ISOIEC Joint Technical Committee 1 - Information Technology , as well as conformity assessment standards developed by ISO CASCO and IEC CAB Conformity Assessment Board. Other standards developed in cooperation between IEC and ISO are assigned numbers in the 80000 series, such as IEC 82045-1. IEC standards are also being adopted by other certifying bodies such as BSI United Kingdom, CSA Canada, UL  ANSI  INCITS United States, SABS South Africa, SAI Australia, SPC  GB China and DIN Germany. IEC standards adopted by other certifying bodies may have some noted differences from the original IEC standard. 9  Membership and participation  edit     Full members    Associate members    Affiliates The IEC is made up of members, called national committees, and each NC represents its nations electrotechnical interests in the IEC. This includes manufacturers, providers, distributors and vendors, consumers and users, all levels of governmental agencies, professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies. National committees are constituted in different ways. Some NCs are public sector only, some are a combination of public and private sector, and some are private sector only. About 90 of those who prepare IEC standards work in industry.

Countries signing a pledge to participate in the work and to encourage the use of IEC Standards in national standards and regulations are granted access to a limited number of technical committee documents for the purposes of commenting. In addition, they can select a limited number of IEC Standards for their national standards library. Countries as of 2011 participating in the Affiliate Country Programme are 16  Afghanistan Angola Antigua and Barbuda Armenia Azerbaijan Bangladesh Barbados Belize Benin Bhutan Bolivia Botswana Brunei Darussalam Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Cameroon Central African Republic Chad Comoros Congo Congo Democratic Rep. of Costa Rica Cte dIvoire Dominica Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Eritrea Ethiopia Fiji Gabon Gambia Ghana Grenada Guatemala Guinea Guinea Bissau Guyana Haiti Honduras Jamaica Kyrgyzstan Lao Pdr Lebanon Lesotho Madagascar Malawi Mali Mauritania Mauritius Mongolia Mozambique Myanmar Namibia Nepal Niger Palestinian Authority Panama Papua New Guinea Paraguay Rwanda Saint Lucia Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Senegal Seychelles Sierra Leone Sudan Suriname Swaziland Tanzania Togo Trinidad and Tobago Turkmenistan Uganda Uruguay Venezuela Yemen Zambia Zimbabwe See also  edit  Wikimedia Commons has media related to International Electrotechnical Commission .
