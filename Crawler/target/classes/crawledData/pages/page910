A page from the book Author Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi Original  title        Language Arabic The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing  Arabic        , Al-kitb al-mukhtaar f isb al-abr wal-muqbala  1  Latin  Liber Algebr et Almucabola , also known as Al-jabr   , is an Arabic mathematical treatise on algebra written by Persian polymath Muammad ibn Ms al-Khwrizm around 820  CE while he was in the Abbasid capital of Baghdad , modern-day Iraq . Al-jabr was a landmark work in the history of mathematics , establishing algebra as an independent discipline, and with the term algebra itself derived from Al-jabr . The Compendious Book provided an exhaustive account of solving for the positive roots of polynomial equations up to the second degree. 2  It was the first text to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake. 3  It also introduced the fundamental concept of reduction and balancing which the term al-jabr originally referred to, the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, i.e. the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. 4  Mathematics historian Victor J. Katz regards Al-Jabr as the first true algebra text that is still extant. 5  Translated into Latin by Robert of Chester in 1145, it was used until the sixteenth century as the principal mathematical textbook of European universities. 6  7  8  9  Several authors have also published texts under this name, including Ab anfa al-Dnawar , Ab Kmil Shuj ibn Aslam , 10  Ab Muammad al-Adl, Ab Ysuf al-Mi, Abd al-Hamd ibn Turk , Sind ibn Al, Sahl ibn Bir, 11  and arafaddn al-s .

It no longer concerns a series of problems to be resolved, but an exposition which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study. On the other hand, the idea of an equation for its own sake appears from the beginning and, one could say, in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, bu t is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems. 12  J. J. OConnor and E. F. Robertson wrote in the MacTutor History of Mathematics archive  Perhaps one of the most significant advances made by Arabic mathematics began at this time with the work of al-Khwarizmi, namely the beginnings of algebra. It is important to understand just how significant this new idea was. It was a revolutionary move away from the Greek concept of mathematics which was essentially geometry. Algebra was a unifying theory which allowed rational numbers , irrational numbers , geometrical magnitudes, etc., to all be treated as algebraic objects. It gave mathematics a whole new development path so much broader in concept to that which had existed before, and provided a vehicle for future development of the subject. Another important aspect of the introduction of algebraic ideas was that it allowed mathematics to be applied to itself in a way which had not happened before. 13  The book  edit  The book was a compilation and extension of known rules for solving quadratic equations and for some other problems, and considered to be the foundation of algebra, establishing it as an independent discipline. The word algebra is derived from the name of one of the basic operations with equations described in this book, following its Latin translation by Robert of Chester . 14  Since the book does not give any citations to previous authors, it is not clearly known what earlier works were used by al-Khwarizmi, and modern mathematical historians put forth opinions based on the textual analysis of the book and the overall body of knowledge of the contemporary Muslim world. There are indications of connections with Indian mathematics , as he had written a book entitled The Book of Bringing Together and Separating According to the Hindu Calculation  Kitb al-Jam wa-l-tafrq bi-isb al-Hind , discussing the Hindu-Arabic numeral system . Quadratic equations  edit  Pages from a 14th-century Arabic copy of the book, showing geometric solutions to two quadratic equations The book classifies quadratic equations to one of the six basic types and provides algebraic and geometric methods to solve the basic ones. Historian Carl Boyer notes the following regarding the lack of modern abstract notations in the book 15  ... the algebra of al-Khwarizmi is thoroughly rhetorical, with none of the syncopation see History of algebra  found in the Greek Arithmetica or in Brahmagupta s work. Even the numbers were written out in words rather than symbols  Carl B. Boyer, A History of Mathematics Thus the equations are verbally described in terms of squares what would today be  x 2 , roots what would today be  x  and numbers constants ordinary spelled out numbers, like forty-two. The six types, with modern notations, are squares equal roots  ax 2  bx  squares equal number  ax 2  c  roots equal number  bx  c  squares and roots equal number  ax 2  bx  c  squares and number equal roots  ax 2  c  bx  roots and number equal squares  bx  c  ax 2  Islamic mathematicians, unlike the Hindus, did not deal with negative numbers at all hence an equation like bx  c  0 does not appear in the classification, because it has no positive solutions if all the coefficients are positive. Similarly equation types 4, 5 and 6, which look equivalent to the modern eye, were distinguished because the coefficients must all be positive. 16  The al-abr forcing, restoring operation is moving a deficient quantity from one side of the equation to the other side. In an al-Khwarizmis example in modern notation,  x 2  40 x    4 x 2  is transformed by al-abr into 5 x 2  40 x . Repeated application of this rule eliminates negative quantities from calculations. Al-Muqabala   , balancing or corresponding means subtraction of the same positive quantity from both sides  x 2  5  40 x  4 x 2  is turned into 5  40 x  3 x 2 . Repeated application of this rule makes quantities of each type squarerootnumber appear in the equation at most once, which helps to see that there are only 6 basic solvable types of the problem, when restricted to positive coefficients and solutions. Subsequent parts of the book do not rely on solving quadratic equations. Area and volume  edit  The second chapter of the book catalogues methods of finding area and volume . These include approximations of pi , given three ways, as 3 17, 10, and 6283220000. This latter approximation, equalling 3.1416, earlier appeared in the Indian ryabhaya 499 CE. 17  Other topics  edit  Al-Khwrizm explicates the Jewish calendar and the 19-year cycle described by the convergence of lunar months and solar years. 17  About half of the book deals with Islamic rules of inheritance , which are complex and require skill in first-order algebraic equations. 18  References  edit   The Arabic title is sometimes condensed to Hisab al-jabr wal-muqabala or Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala or given under other transliterations .

Gandz and Saloman 1936, The sources of al-Khwarizmis algebra , Osiris i, p. 263277 In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called the father of algebra than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers.   Boyer 1991 , The Arabic Hegemony p. 229 It is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word al-jabr presumably meant something like restoration or completion and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, which is evident in the treatise the word muqabalah is said to refer to reduction or balancingthat is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.
