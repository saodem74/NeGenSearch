The components of information engineering include more theoretical fields such as machine learning , artificial intelligence , control theory , signal processing , and information theory , and more applied fields such as computer vision , natural language processing , bioinformatics , medical image computing , cheminformatics , autonomous robotics , mobile robotics , and telecommunications . 1  2  5  6  7  Many of these originate from computer science , as well as other branches of engineering such as computer engineering , electrical engineering , and bioengineering . An example of clustering in machine learning . The field of information engineering is based heavily on mathematics , particularly probability , statistics , calculus , linear algebra , optimization , differential equations , variational calculus , and complex analysis . Information engineers often  citation needed  hold a degree in information engineering or a related area, and are often part of a professional body such as the Institution of Engineering and Technology or Institute of Measurement and Control . 8  9  10  They are employed in almost all industries due to the widespread use of information engineering.

It began to gain its current meaning early on in the 21st century .  citation needed  Elements  edit  Machine learning and statistics  edit  Main article Machine learning Machine learning is the field that involves the use of statistical and probabilistic methods to let computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed. 11  Data science involves the application of machine learning to extract knowledge from data. Subfields of machine learning include deep learning , supervised learning , unsupervised learning , reinforcement learning , semi-supervised learning , and active learning . Causal inference is another related component of information engineering. Control theory  edit  Main article Control theory Control theory refers to the control of  continuous  dynamical systems , with the aim being to avoid delays, overshoots, or instability . 12  Information engineers tend to focus more on control theory rather than the physical design of control systems and circuits which tends to fall under electrical engineering. Subfields of control theory include classical control , optimal control , and nonlinear control . Signal processing  edit  Main article Signal processing Signal processing refers to the generation, analysis and use of signals , which could take many forms such as image , sound , electrical, or biological. 13  An example of how the 2D Fourier transform can be used to remove unwanted information from an X-ray scan . Information theory  edit  Main article Information theory Information theory studies the analysis, transmission, and storage of information. Major subfields of information theory include coding and data compression . 14  Computer vision  edit  Main article Computer vision Computer vision is the field that deals with getting computers to understand image and video data at a high level. 15  Natural language processing  edit  Main article Natural language processing Natural language processing deals with getting computers to understand human natural languages at a high level. This usually means text , but also often includes speech processing and recognition . 16  Bioinformatics  edit  Main article Bioinformatics Bioinformatics is the field that deals with the analysis, processing, and use of biological data. 17  This usually means topics such as genomics and proteomics , and sometimes also includes medical image computing . Cheminformatics  edit  Main article Cheminformatics Cheminformatics is the field that deals with the analysis, processing, and use of chemical data. 18  Robotics  edit  Main article Robotics Robotics in information engineering focuses mainly on the algorithms and computer programs used to control robots . As such, information engineering tends to focus more on autonomous, mobile, or probabilistic robots. 19  20  21  Major subfields studied by information engineers include control , perception , SLAM , and motion planning . 19  20  Tools  edit  In the past some areas in information engineering such as signal processing used analog electronics , but nowadays most information engineering is done with digital computers . Many tasks in information engineering can be parallelized , and so nowadays information engineering is carried out using CPUs , GPUs , and AI accelerators . 22  23  There has also been interest in using quantum computers for some subfields of information engineering such as machine learning and robotics . 24  25  26  See also  edit  Aerospace engineering Chemical engineering Civil engineering Internet of things List of engineering branches Mechanical engineering Statistics References  edit   a b 2009 lecture  Past Lectures  BCSIET Turing lecture  Events  BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT . www.bcs.org .
