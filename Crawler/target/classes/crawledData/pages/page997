Contents 1 Two views 1.1 The analytic view 1.2 The synthetic view 2 See also 3 Notes 4 References 5 External links Two views  edit  There are two contrasting points of view on what Leibniz meant by calculus ratiocinator . The first is associated with computer software , the second is associated with computer hardware . The analytic view  edit  The received point of view in analytic philosophy and formal logic , is that the calculus ratiocinator anticipates mathematical logic an algebra of logic. 1  The analytic point of view understands that the calculus ratiocinator is a formal inference engine or computer program , which can be designed so as to grant primacy to calculations. That logic began with Frege s 1879 Begriffsschrift and C.S. Peirce s writings on logic in the 1880s. Frege intended his concept script to be a calculus ratiocinator as well as a lingua characteristica . That part of formal logic relevant to the calculus comes under the heading of proof theory . From this perspective the calculus ratiocinator is only a part or a subset of the universal characteristic , and a complete universal characteristic includes a logical calculus. The synthetic view  edit  A contrasting point of view stems from synthetic philosophy and fields such as cybernetics , electronic engineering and general systems theory . It is little appreciated in analytic philosophy. The synthetic view understands the calculus ratiocinator as referring to a calculating machine. The cybernetician Norbert Wiener considered Leibnizs calculus ratiocinator a forerunner to the modern day digital computer  The history of the modern computing machine goes back to Leibniz and Pascal. Indeed, the general idea of a computing machine is nothing but a mechanization of Leibnizs calculus ratiocinator . Wiener 1948 214   ...like his predecessor Pascal, Leibniz was interested in the construction of computing machines in the Metal. ... just as the calculus of arithmetic lends itself to a mechanization progressing through the abacus and the desk computing machine to the utra-rapid computing machines of the present day, so the calculus ratiocinator of Leibniz contains the germs of the machina ratiocinatrix , the reasoning machine Wiener 1965 12  Leibniz constructed just such a machine for mathematical calculations, which was also called a Stepped Reckoner . As a computing machine, the ideal calculus ratiocinator would perform Leibnizs integral and differential calculus. In this way the meaning of the word, ratiocinator is clarified and can be understood as a mechanical instrument that combines and compares ratios. Photo of the mechanism of the Stepped Reckoner A contemporary replica of the Stepped Reckoner Hartley Rogers saw a link between the two, defining the calculus ratiocinator as an algorithm which, when applied to the symbols of any formula of the characteristica universalis, would determine whether or not that formula were true as a statement of science Hartley Rogers, Jr. 1963 p.  934. A classic discussion of the calculus ratiocinator is Couturat 1901 chapters 3 and 4, who maintained that the characteristica universalis and thus the calculus ratiocinator were inseparable from Leibnizs encyclopedic project chapter 5. Hence the characteristic , calculus ratiocinator , and encyclopedia form three pillars of Leibnizs project.
