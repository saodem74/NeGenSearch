To display maintenance messages, include the following text in your common CSS page or your specific skins CSS page  common.css and skin.css respectively . mw-parser-output span . cs1-maint  display  inline   display Citation Style 1 maintenance messages  Even with this css installed, older pages in Wikipedias cache may not have been updated to show these error messages even though the page is listed in one of the tracking categories. A null edit will resolve that issue. To hide error messages . mw-parser-output span . cs1-visible-error  display  none   hide Citation Style 1 error messages  You can personalize the display of these messages such as changing the color, but you will need to ask someone who knows CSS or at the technical village pump if you do not understand how. Most common errors Citation without a title of any form , 33k pages Check date values in  param1 ,  param2 , ... , 28k pages Bare URL without a title , 26k pages access-date requires url , 20k pages External link in  param  , 18k pages Missing or empty url , 14k pages access-date requires url Help desk access-date requires url The access-date  or its alias, accessdate   is the date that the online resource addressed by url  was added to the article. If access-date  has been included in the citation without url  then this message appears. If the citation does not use a web link, then access-date  is redundant and should be removed. When the online resource has a publication or other fixed date associated with it, access-date  is of limited value though may be useful in identifying an appropriate archived version of the resource. Without url  , access-date  is not considered useful. To resolve this error, provide a value for url  or remove access-date  . Editors should try to determine why the citation has access-date  without url  . For example, the citation may never have had a url  , or url  may have been removed because it links to a site that violates the creators copyright see WPCOPYLINK , or because url  was deemed to be dead. If the citation never had url  or it was removed for copyright violations, remove access-date  . When a dead url  has been removed, restore the url  and if possible repair it see WPLINKROT .

When Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates contain date-holding parameters, an automated test is done to see if the dates are real dates that comply with a subset of the date rules in Wikipedias Manual of Style, specifically checking for violations of MOSDATEFORMAT . To resolve this error, ensure that the date is an actual date and that the date format follows the Wikipedia Manual of Styles guidance on dates in the named parameter. See examples of unacceptable dates and how to fix them , below. Or, some conceptual issues to look for impossible dates, such as 29 February 2011 access-date  must specify a day, not just a month or year. misplaced, incorrect, or extraneous punctuation extraneous text hyphens or slashes instead of en dashes in date ranges en dashes are required misspelling or improper capitalization see MOSALLCAPS for more detail that is not in Wikipedia Manual of Styles guidance on dates  other unacceptable date formats listed in MOSBADDATEFORMAT more than one date in a date-holding parameter Does not handle years before 100 AD, including BCEBC dates. Try using parameter orig-year  instead. See Help Citation Style 1 for information about limitations in the CS1 citation templates handling of date formats. The MOS section on date ranges describes how to separate dates in a date range. Do not use nbsp , ndash , or  spaced ndash  as these corrupt the metadata. To add an en dash, use the CharInsert edit tool or see WikipediaHow to make dashes . You may also use this one . A bot is often able to correct the separator, provided the overall format is unambiguous. Future dates in date  in CS12 citations are limited to current year  1 that is, for 2019, citation dates in 2020 are acceptable but citation dates in 2021 and beyond are not. Dates prior to 1582 are treated as Julian calendar dates. Dates from 1582 onward are treated as Gregorian calendar dates. The Julian calendar was used in some places until approximately 1923. Three Julian calendar dates in the overlap period, 29 February in the years 1700, 1800, and 1900, will cause this error message because those years are not leap years in the Gregorian calendar. The access date in access-date   is checked to ensure that it contains a full date day, month, and year and is between 15 January 2001 the founding date of Wikipedia and todays date plus one day, because it represents the date that an editor viewed a web-based source to verify a statement on Wikipedia. Because editors may be in time zones that are one day ahead of the UTC date, one extra day is accepted .

Additionally, the doi  value is checked to make sure that it does not contain spaces, en dashes, does not end with punctuation, or uses the invalidtemporarytest DOI prefix 10.5555 . Further validation of the DOI is not performed. To resolve this error, ensure that the doi  value is correct. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors DOI . a  Check hdl value Help desk Check hdl value When Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates contain hdl  , a test is done to see if the hdl value looks like a properly defined value.

To resolve this error, ensure that the hdl  value is correct. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors HDL . a  Check isbn value Help desk Check isbn value type  Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates that contain isbn  are checked to ensure that the ISBN is the proper length ten or thirteen digits, that the ISBN uses the correct optional separators simple space or hyphen, and that the final check digit is correct according to the ISBN specification. Only one ISBN is allowed in this field because the whole isbn  value is included in the citations COinS metadata . See also WikipediaCOinS . More than one ISBN, or characters that are not part of the ISBN, corrupt the COinS metadata and may also corrupt the link to SpecialBookSources . The error message type  indicator can be length  ISBN is not 10 or 13 digits checksum  ISBN has one or more incorrect digits look for typos and transposition invalid character  ISBN has one or more digits that is not in the allowed set appropriate to ISBN length invalid prefix  13-digit ISBNs must begin with 978 or 979 invalid form  10-digit ISBNs with the mis-positioned X character To resolve this error, ensure that the isbn  value is correct, that only one ISBN is used, that the proper optional separators are used, and that no other text is included. Use the 13-digit ISBN when it is available . When a 10-digit ISBN is used, if the check digit is a lowercase x, change it to an uppercase X. Do not try to resolve the error by simply recalculating the check digit. The check digit is there to check whether the main part of the number is correct. If the ISBN is failing to validate, it is likely that there is a typo in the main part of the number. In this case, recalculating the check digit results in an apparently valid ISBN that leads to the wrong source or to nowhere . If you only have a 10-digit ISBN, do use the number as-is, do not try to convert it to the 13-digit form. If the ISBN as printed in your source is refusing to validate, do check both the front matter and the book cover for ISBNs. It is not uncommon for the ISBN to be misprinted in the front matter but correct on the cover. Do preview your edit and check that the new ISBN does now link to the correct source. In very rare cases, publishers have released books with malformed ISBNs. If you are certain that a non-conforming ISBN truly corresponds to the published work, then you can add ignore-isbn-error true to the citation in order to suppress the error message. In many cases, books may have been reissued with a corrected ISBN. Use a corrected ISBN when possible. Sometimes there are numbers assigned to isbn  that appear to be legitimate  length is right, check digit is correct  but that arent true ISBN numbers. This tool may be helpful.

Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors ISBN . a  Check ismn value Help desk Check ismn value Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates that contain ismn  are checked to ensure that the ISMN is the proper length thirteen digits, that the ISMN uses the correct optional separators simple space or hyphen, and that the final check digit is correct according to the ISMN specification. Only one ISMN is allowed in this field because the whole ismn  value is included in the citations COinS metadata . See also WikipediaCOinS . More than one ISMN, or characters that are not part of the ISMN, corrupt the COinS metadata. To resolve this error, ensure that the ismn  value is correct, that only one ISMN is used, that the proper optional separators are used, and that no other text is included. Make sure that the ISMN contains exactly 13 digits. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors ISMN . a  Check issn value Help desk Check issn value Check eissn value Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates that contain issn  andor eissn  are checked to ensure that the ISSN is the proper length eight digits and that the final check digit validates according to the ISSN specification. Only one each of ISSN and eISSN is allowed in this field because the whole issn  and eissn  values are included in the citations COinS metadata . See also WikipediaCOinS . The ISSN and eISSN are always rendered as two four-digit numbers separated with a hyphen. To resolve this error, ensure that the issn  and eissn  values are correct, that only one value per parameter is used, and that no other text is included allowable characters are 0-9, X, and -. If the check-digit is a lowercase x, change it to an uppercase X.

To resolve this error, ensure that the jfm  value is correct. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors JFM . a  Check lccn value Help desk Check lccn value The lccn  parameter is the Library of Congress Control Number identifier. It is checked to ensure that the identifier is the proper length and has the correct initial digits. LCCN is a character string 812 characters long. The length of the LCCN dictates the character type of the initial 13 characters the rightmost eight are always digits. 5  LCCN format description Length Description 8 all characters are digits 9 first character is a lower case letter 10 first two characters are either both lower case letters or both digits 11 first character is a lower case letter, second and third characters are either both lower case letters or both digits 12 first two characters are both lower case letters Further validation is not performed. To resolve this error, ensure that the lccn  value is correct and that there are no other letters, punctuation, or other characters. When receiving this error, be on the lookout for publishers who omitted leading zeros in the LCCN following the two or four digit year. For example, an LCCN that is properly 92-035427 could be shortened in the printed work to 92-35247 . When experimenting with inserting omitted zeroes, cross-check the finished number against the LCCN permalinks online.

For example, this citation is marked as empty even though it contains usable information cite web  httpwww.foobar.com  The Foobar News The citation is empty because it does not contain the necessary parameter identifiers in this case url  and title   that tell  cite web  how to use the information that the citation does contain. A citation is also marked as empty when it contains only parameters that it doesnt recognize cite book titoloThe Bazquux Uprising anno2015 This citation is empty because the Italian-language parameters titolo  and anno  are not recognized as valid parameter names on the English Wikipedia. Empty citation may also mean that an editor meant to use another template entirely. Perhaps the editor used  citation  when the intent was to use  citation needed  or  quote  . To resolve this error, add appropriate parameter identifiers, translate foreign language parameter names to their English equivalents, or replace the CS1CS2 template with a more appropriate template.

Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors markup . a  Missing  name  n  Help desk Missing  name  n  So that all names are listed in a rendered citation, Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates require n in  last  n  and its aliases to increment by 1 for each name in the list author, contributor, editor, interviewer, translator. This error message is emitted when there is a hole in the numbering an author list made up of author1  and author3  but without author2  for example. The test will not detect a hole that is larger than 1. It is presumed that when author n  and author n1  are both not present, then the test has reached the end of the list. To resolve this error, ensure that the numbering of the  last  n  parameters increments properly. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors missing name . a  Missing pipe Help desk Missing pipe in param  Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates report this error when one parameter has text that looks like it is a parameter missing a pipe. This error occurs when a template parameter value contains characters and digits followed by an equal sign. If the alphanumeric text immediately preceding the equal sign is a valid cs12 parameter name, the module assumes that the template is missing a pipe and emits this error message. Some legitimate titles will contain a cs12 parameter name followed by an equal sign. In that case, enclose the equal sign in nowiki tags, like this nowiki   nowiki  . For most other cases, simply add the missing pipe. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors missing pipe . a  Missing or empty title There are two slightly different error conditions that can arise when CS1 citations lack appropriate titles. In each case, CS1 reports this error message. The necessary resolution may vary depending on the cause of the error. The error message links to the appropriate description below. Bare URL without a title Help desk  param  missing title All Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates report this error when one of the URL -containing parameters cannot be paired with an associated title. This error may also occur when title  cannot be linked with url  because the citation also contains a conflicting title-link  parameter. URL-containing parameters and associated title parameters URL parameters Title parameters archive-url  title  chapter-url  chapter  , contribution  , entry  , article  conference-url  conference  contribution-url  chapter  , contribution  , entry  , article  transcript-url  transcript  url  title  A unique case exists if pmc  has a value and url  is omitted or empty, then title  is linked with the same URL as the PMC. Because URLs are ugly and generally uninformative, it is expected that editors should provide a meaningful title for each URL. In most cases this can be accomplished by using the title  parameter. To resolve this error, provide an appropriate title for the URL-containing parameter. In the case where url  and title-link  are contending for title  you must choose which one to keep. Consider moving url  or title-link  to a more suitable parameter. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryPages with citations having bare URLs . a  Citation without a title of any form Help desk Missing or empty title Missing or empty series This error occurs for Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates when all of title  , trans-title  , and script-title  are omitted or left blank. At least one of these title parameters must be provided for each citation.  cite episode  will show this error if series  is omitted or left blank even if a title  is provided. Sometimes this error occurs because an editor has used a CS12 citation as a shortened footnote when  sfn  or one of the  harv  family of templates would have been more appropriate. This error also occurs when an editor used  citation  but intended to use  citation needed  . To resolve this error, provide a value for title  , trans-title  , andor script-title  or replace the CS12 template with a more appropriate template. If you are listing a periodical or an issue of a periodical in a bibliography rather than within ref ...  ref  tags,  List journal  may be more appropriate. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryPages with citations lacking titles . a  Missing or empty url Help desk Missing or empty url This error message is reported by  cite web  ,  cite podcast  , and  cite mailing list  when the template parameters url  and archive-url  are both missing, blank or not properly entered. Note that website  or work  is the name of the site, not the URL. To resolve this error, provide a value for url  or use a more appropriate template such as   cite book  ,   cite journal   or other Citation Style 1 or Citation Style 2 template. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryPages using web citations with no URL . a  More than one of  param1 ,  param2 , and  param3  specified Help desk More than one of  param1  ,  param2  , and  param3  specified This error occurs when a Citation Style 1 or Citation Style 2 template includes more than one parameter that maps to the same meaning. For example, author  , last  , and last1  are all synonyms of each other, so no more than one of these parameters should ever be used in a single template. To resolve this error, remove or modify the redundant parameters. More than one of author-name-list parameters specified More than one of editor-name-list parameters specified This error occurs when a CS1 or CS2 template uses more than one type of author or editor name-list style. There are three kinds of incompatible author-name-list styles author n  and last n   first n  and their various aliases, vauthors  , and authors  and similarly, three editor-name-list styles editor n  and editor-last n   editor-first n  and their various aliases, veditors  , and editors  To resolve this error, choose one name-list-style. Use the chosen style for both of the author and editor name-lists. Pages with these errors are automatically placed in CategoryPages with citations having redundant parameters . a  Text  ignored Help desk Text  ignored Unlike many Wikipedia templates, the Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates do not use unnamed or positional parameters. When a citation contains text between vertical bars and that text does not contain an equal sign , CS12 ignores the text and reports the error. This is true even when the text is the name of a valid parameter. This error can also be caused by vertical bars that are part of URLs or titles. When vertical bars occur in URLs, replace each vertical bar with 7c . When vertical bars occur in parameter values that are not URLs, replace each vertical bar with 124 or      . To resolve this error, remove the extraneous text, add , add an appropriate parameter name from the template youre using to complete the parameter, or properly encode vertical bars in URLs and titles. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryPages with citations using unnamed parameters . a  trans- param  requires  param  Help desk trans-title requires title trans-chapter requires chapter Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates report this error when the citation has an English translation of the title in trans-title  or chapter title in trans-chapter  but does not have the original-language title in title  or original-language chapter title in chapter  . To resolve this error, provide the original language title for title  or chapter title for chapter  . Consider adding language  if not already part of the citation. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors translated title . a  Unknown parameter xxxx ignored Help desk Unknown parameter xxxx ignored Unknown parameter xxxx ignored  yyyy suggested Citation Style 1 and Citation Style 2 templates report this error when the name portion of a parameters name value pair is not recognized as a valid name. Typically, this is caused by spelling or capitalization errors. With the old-style citation templates, it was possible to include information within the template that was simply ignored as unrecognized parameters. The Lua-based CS12 engine does not ignore unrecognized parameters. The purpose of the citation is to properly identify the source not act as a repository of notes and ancillary information. CS12 template parameters are lower case. CS12 will report this error when the parameters name contains uppercase letters  Xxxx, xxXx, XXXX  but the parameters name is defined as lowercase  xxxx . The identifier parameters, like isbn  , pmc  , doi  , etc., can be either lower case or upper case, but not of mixed case  isbn  or ISBN  but not Isbn  . For common parameter misspellings , like pubisher  instead of publisher  , CS12 will suggest a valid parameter name. To resolve this error, replace the erroneous parameter name with a correct one, possibly using the suggested name. Ensure that the parameters name is correctly spelled and that there are no characters except spaces between the parameters name and the leading vertical bar  or trailing equals sign . A list of valid parameters can be found by consulting HelpCitation Style 1 or visiting the description page of the specific template being used, such as  cite web  ,  cite book  ,  cite journal  , etc. Consider moving information associated with the unknown parameter into an appropriate parameter or to a section of the articles talk page for preservation. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryPages with citations using unsupported parameters . a  Unsupported parameters in cite arXiv Help desk Unsupported parameters in cite arXiv  cite arXiv  uses a limited subset of the common Citation Style 1 parameters. This error message is emitted when parameters not in the cite arXiv subset occur in a cite arXiv template. To resolve this error, remove the unsupported parameters. See TemplateCite arXiv for the complete list of supported parameters. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors arXiv . a  URLwikilink conflict Help desk URLwikilink conflict External links in a rendered citation are a combination of url-holding parameters, url  , chapter-url  , etc., with title-holding parameters, title  , chapter  , etc. Title-holding parameters may be wikilinked to another Wikipedia article but not when there is a matching url-holding parameter in the citation. When this condition occurs, the wikilink is suppressed, the wiki markup ignored, and the rendered citation links to the external site. Some templates will also cause this error if they are part of a title-holding parameter. The error occurs when the template produces wikilinked content. For example,  lang  templates output a wikilinked category. Templates in url-holding parameters may also corrupt the citations COinS metadata. As a general rule, avoid using templates in title-holding parameters unless you know that the templates effects are entirely visual     and the like. This type of error may also occur in identifier-based templates   cite doi  , etc.. When this happens, the error message is shown in the article but the error is actually located in the identifier-based citation template. To resolve this error, remove wikilinks from title-holding parameters that are intended to be externally linked or remove the external URL, which will allow the internal wikilinks to work as expected. If wikilink-producing templates are important to the citation, move them out of the CS1 template but leave them inside the citations ref ...  ref  tags. Some of the functionality provided by templates may also be available through CS1 parameters. To resolve errors in identifier-based citation templates, the template must be edited to correct the error. Exercise caution when editing these templates because identifier-based citation templates are often used in multiple articles. Pages with this error are automatically placed in CategoryCS1 errors URLwikilink conflict . a  Vancouver style error Help desk Vancouver style error This error is reported for citations that use vauthors  , veditors  , name-list-format vanc . Vancouver style restricts author or editor names to the Latin alphabet. For the purposes of this test, ModuleCitationCS1 defines the Latin alphabet as the letters defined in the Unicode Latin character sets C0 Controls and Basic Latin 8  0041005A, 0061007A C1 Controls and Latin-1 Supplement 9  00C000D6, 00D800F6, 00F800FF Latin Extended-A 10  0100017F Latin Extended-B 11  018001BF, 01C4024F This error is also reported when more than two initials are used in case of more than two initials, list only the first two. This error is also reported when a corporate or institutional author is listed in vauthors  without proper delimiters. Corporate authors should be listed this way vauthors First Surname FM, Surname AB,  Corporate or institutional Author  , Lastsurname XY While normally correct, sometimes the names listed on a PMID page contain errors when the author surname has a lowercase nobiliary particle . For example, PMID   17726700 lists Magnus von Knebel Doeberitz as Doeberitz Mv which is not correct. This authors name should be listed as vauthors von Knebel Doeberitz M . 12  Certain punctuation will be flagged as an error. For example, Unicode U2019, right single quotation mark, causes an error because it is not a member of the Latin character sets identified above vauthors Van  t Veer M . Replace this character with the straight or typewriter apostrophe vauthors Van  t Veer M . To resolve this error, Romanize author and editor names. 13  Romanizing can result in two-letter initials, for example, the Greek letter  Romanizes to Th. 14  When author names have this kind of initial, ModuleCitationCS1 cant know if this kind of initial is a typo or a legitimate Romanized character so it will emit the Vancouver error. To suppress the error after determining that the two-character initial is correct and not a typo, treat the name as if it were a corporate name by wrapping it in doubled parentheses vauthors ..., Tatarinov IuS, ...  vauthors ..., Tatarinov IuS, ... Similarly, Chinese hyphenated given names may appear in PubMed listings. For example Wang Hsien-yu may be listed on PubMed as Wang Hy which will result in a Vancouver error. When this occurs, and upon verification that such names are correct, wrap them in doubled parentheses.

Space characters between the assignment operator the  sign and the parameter value are not counted. name  stripmarker in  param  at position n Strip markers are special sequences of characters that MediaWiki inserts as a place-holder for certain xml -like tags. These tags include gallery ...  gallery  , math ...  math  , nowiki ...  nowiki  , pre ...  pre  , and ref ...  ref  . The strip markers are replaced with content before the final page rendering. The module ignores math and nowiki strip markers. To resolve strip marker errors, remove or replace the identified tag. The error message identifies the strip markers position in the parameter value counted from the left. Space characters between the assignment operator the  sign and the parameter value are not counted. Strip marker errors can also be caused by unsupported additional text or templates in parameter valuesfor example,   ISBN   in title  .
