She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL , an early high-level programming language still in use today. Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College . Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken . In 1949, she joined the EckertMauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At EckertMauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker originally called a compiler, which was written for the A-0 System . 2  3  4  5  During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1. In 1954, EckertMauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC . In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation , sharing her computing experiences. The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke -class guided-missile destroyer USS   Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 Hopper supercomputer at NERSC . 6  During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor. In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology . On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama . 7  Contents 1 Early life and education 2 Career 2.1 World War II 2.2 UNIVAC 2.3 COBOL 2.4 Standards 3 Retirement 4 Post-retirement 5 Anecdotes 6 Death 7 Dates of rank 8 Awards and honors 8.1 Military awards 8.2 Other awards 9 Legacy 9.1 Places 9.2 Programs 9.3 In popular culture 9.3.1 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 10 Obituary notices 11 See also 12 References 13 Further reading 14 External links Early life and education  edit  Grace Hopper As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith Problems playing this file See media help . Hopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent, and attended West End Collegiate Church . 8  Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War . 8   23 Grace was very curious as a child this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing she was then limited to one clock. 9  For her preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey . Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 her test scores in Latin were too low, but she was admitted the following year. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelors degree in mathematics and physics and earned her masters degree at Yale University in 1930. In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale 10  under the direction of ystein Ore . 11  12  Her dissertation , New Types of Irreducibility Criteria, was published that same year. 13  Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in 1941. 14  She was married to New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper 19061976 from 1930 until their divorce in 1945. 11  15  She did not marry again, but chose to retain his surname. Career  edit  World War II  edit  Hoppers signatures on a duty officer signup sheet for the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard, which built and operated the Mark I Hopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in World War II . She was rejected for a few reasons. At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort. 16  During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve  she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the WAVES . She had to get an exemption to enlist she was 15 pounds 6.8  kg below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds 54  kg. She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmens School at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts . Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by Howard H. Aiken . Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hoppers request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard. 17  Hopper in a computer room in Washington, D.C. , 1978, photographed by Lynn Gilbert UNIVAC  edit  In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the EckertMauchly Computer Corporation as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the UNIVAC I . 14  Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I. 18  When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she was told very quickly that she couldnt do this because computers didnt understand English. Still she persisted. Its much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols, she explained. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. 19  Her idea was not accepted for 3 years. In the meantime, she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the Remington Rand corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original compiler work was done. The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was A-0 . 20   11 In 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that Nobody believed that, and that she had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic. 21  She goes on to say that her compiler translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. Its much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of COBOL , a computer language for data processors. I could say Subtract income tax from pay instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. COBOL is the major language used today in data processing. 22  In 1954 Hopper was named the companys first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including MATH-MATIC and FLOW-MATIC . 14  COBOL  edit  Hopper at the UNIVAC I console, c. 1960 In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages  CODASYL . Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language COBOL an acronym for CO mmon B usiness- O riented L anguage. The new language extended Hoppers FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN . Hoppers belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages  was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date. 23  Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was Mount Holyoke College alumnus Jean E. Sammet . 24  From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navys Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973. 17  She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy. 17  Standards  edit  In the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network. 20   119 She developed the implementation of standards for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early programming languages such as FORTRAN and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests and their official administration were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards NBS, known today as the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST. Retirement  edit  Hopper being promoted to the rank of commodore in 1983 In accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of commander at age 60 at the end of 1966. 25  She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment. She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to captain in 1973 by Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr. 26  After Republican Representative Philip Crane saw her on a March 1983 segment of 60 Minutes , he championed H.J.Res. 341 , a joint resolution originating in the House of Representatives , which led to her promotion on 15 December 1983 to commodore by special Presidential appointment by President Ronald Reagan . 26  27  28  29  She remained on active duty for several years beyond mandatory retirement by special approval of Congress. 30  Effective November 8, 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral lower half and Hopper became one of the Navys few female admirals. Following a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986. 31  At a celebration held in Boston on the USS   Constitution to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the Defense Distinguished Service Medal , the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense. 32  At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy 79 years, eight months and five days, and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy 188 years, nine months and 23 days. 33  Admirals William D. Leahy , Chester W. Nimitz , Hyman G. Rickover and Charles Stewart were the only other officers in the Navys history to serve on active duty at a higher age. Leahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of fleet admiral . Post-retirement  edit  Following her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to Digital Equipment Corporation DEC. Hopper was initially offered the job position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on applying for the position at DEC, and going through the typical formal interview process. She also sent a letter to Yavinskys boss explaining that she would be available on alternating Thursdays, receiving a high salary, and have access to an unlimited expense account if she were to be exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer. After the proposal from Hopper, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant. As part of her position, she would report to Yavinsky. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations. 8  She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992. Hopper was a goodwill ambassador in her primary activity in this capacity. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digitals engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures which is not allowed under U.S. Department of Defense regulation 32 CFR 53.2a2. The most important thing Ive accomplished, other than building the compiler, she said, is training young people. They come to me, you know, and say, Do you think we can do this I say, Try it. And I back em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir em up at intervals so they dont forget to take chances. 34  Anecdotes  edit  Photo of first computer bug  a moth Throughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname Grandma COBOL. 35  While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University in 1947, 36  her associates discovered a moth that was stuck in a relay  the moth impeded the operation of the relay. While neither Hopper nor her crew mentioned the phrase  debugging  in their logs, the case was held as an instance of literal debugging. For many years, the term bug had been in use in engineering. 37  38  The remains of the moth can be found in the groups log book at the Smithsonian Institution s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. 36  Grace Hopper is famous for her nanoseconds visual aid. People such as generals and admirals used to ask her why satellite communication took so long. She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long 11.8 inches 30  cmthe distance that light travels in one nanosecond . She gave these pieces of wire the metonym nanoseconds. 29  She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out nanoseconds to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet 300 meters long, 39  representing a microsecond . Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds . 40  Jay Elliot described Grace Hopper as appearing to be all Navy, but when you reach inside, you find a Pirate dying to be released. 41  Death  edit  On New Years Day 1992, Hopper died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Arlington, Virginia 42  she was 85 years of age. She was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery . 43  Dates of rank  edit  Apprentice Seaman and Midshipman  May 4, 1944 44  Lieutenant junior grade  June 27, 1944 44  Lieutenant  June 1, 1946 44  Lieutenant Commander  April 1, 1952 44  Commander  July 1, 1957 44  Retired  December 31, 1966 44  Recalled to active duty  August 1, 1967 44  Retired  1971 44  Captain  August 2, 1973 44  Commodore  December 15, 1983 44  Rear Admiral Lower Half  November 8, 1985 44  Final retirement  August 31, 1986 44  Awards and honors  edit  Military awards  edit  Top Row Defense Distinguished Service Medal 1986 Legion of Merit 1967 Meritorious Service Medal 1980 2nd Row Presidential Medal of Freedom 2016, Posthumous American Campaign Medal 1944 World War II Victory Medal 1945 Bottom Row National Defense Service Medal with bronze service star 1953, 1966 Armed Forces Reserve Medal with two bronze hourglass devices 1963, 1973, 1983 Naval Reserve Medal 1953 Other awards  edit  1964 Hopper was awarded the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award, the Societys highest honor, In recognition of her significant contributions to the burgeoning computer industry as an engineering manager and originator of automatic programming systems. 45  1969 Hopper was awarded the inaugural Data Processing Management Association Man of the Year award now called the Distinguished Information Sciences Award. 46  1971 The annual Grace Murray Hopper Award for Outstanding Young Computer Professionals was established in 1971 by the Association for Computing Machinery . 47  1973 First American and the first woman of any nationality to be made a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society . 48  1982 American Association of University Women Achievement Award and an Honorary Doctor of Science from Marquette University . 49  1985 Honorary Doctor of Letters from Western New England College now Western New England University . 50  51  1986 Upon her retirement, she received the Defense Distinguished Service Medal. 1986 Honorary Doctor of Science from Syracuse University. 52  1987 The first Computer History Museum Fellow Award Recipient for contributions to the development of programming languages, for standardization efforts, and for lifelong naval service. 53  1988 Golden Gavel Award, Toastmasters International . 54  1991 National Medal of Technology . 55  1991 Elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . 56  1994 Inducted into the National Womens Hall of Fame . 57  1996 USS   Hopper   DDG-70 was launched. 47  Nicknamed Amazing Grace , it is on a very short list of U.S. military vessels named after women . 2001 Eavan Boland wrote a poem dedicated to Grace Hopper titled Code in her 2001 release Against Love Poetry . 58  2001 The Gracies, the Government Technology Leadership Award were named in her honor. 59  2009 The Department of Energys National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center named its flagship system Hopper. 60  2009 Office of Naval Intelligence creates the Grace Hopper Information Services Center. 61  2013 Google made the Google Doodle for Hoppers 107th birthday an animation of her sitting at a computer, using COBOL to print out her age.
